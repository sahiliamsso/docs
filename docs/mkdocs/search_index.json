This section is dedicated to all tuning and tinkering except integration tools.\nThe configuration menu is divided in to other sections which are revealed on click. The administrator can manage authentication, registration, attributes, cache-refresh,logs etc. from this menu.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three sections in the organization configuration page which are \nSystem Configuration\n, \nSMTP Server Configuration\n and \nOxTrust Settings\n. These sections are detailed below with screenshots.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n\nGluu Server CE is shipped with a built-in \nWhite Pages\n feature which can be enabled from the system configuration page. This page also contains the options to enable \nSelf-Service Password Reset\n which allows the Gluu Server users to reset their password via email. This options depends on the \nSMTP Server Configuration\n, also available under the organization configuration page. Additionally the \nSCIM Support\n can be enabled from the System Configuration page. If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be updated from the System Configuration interface. \nMaximum Log Size (MB)*\n, by default Gluu UI will have 200 mb as the size of the log file and this value could be manipulated according to the administrator. Either this value could be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n\nThe mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.\n\n\n\nOxTrust Settings\n\nSome basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page. The administrator can change the organization name, logo and favicon settings from this page as well. Finally oxTrust Settings page contains the name of the administrator group for Gluu Server. The users added in this group will have administrator access in Gluu Server where they will be able to maintain/configure the server.\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe configuration files are accessible from the administrator interface (oxTrust). \nThere are three tabs under the \nJSON Configuration\n menu\n\n\n\n\nThe oxtrust JSON configuration file is accessible from this tab and it can be edited from this page. The changes are updated by clicking on the \nUpdate\n button on the bottom of the page. \n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. This page also contains the supported response, grants and algorithms among other information. The details will follow later on this documentation.\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for the file method of importing users into Gluu Server CE. The administrator can import users from a \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import data in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nThe \nManage Authentication\n page contains the internal OpenDJ settings for Gluu Server CE. \nThe \nDefault Authentication Method\n defines the authentication mechanism used for general \nauthentication and oxTrust authentication. The separation is introduced because the users \nlogging into Service Providers (SP) do not see the administrative console. \nThe \noxTrust authentication mode\n decides the authentication mechasims for the users \nlogging into the oxTrust admin interface.\n\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nIt will not be an understatement to say that the custom script feature makes \nGluu Server CE so robust and dynamic. The scripts are available for all intents \nand purposes the major being multi-factor authentication. There are many custom scritps \nincluded with the vanilla Gluu Server CE which can be enabled by clicking the check box. This section is \ndiscussed in detail under \nUser Authentication Guide\n \n\n\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE is shiped with the feature to register users via the user-registration endpoint. \nThe registry feature contains a Captcha which can be disabled from this page. Additionally it is \npossible to enable registration configuration from attributes.\n\n\nThis tabs has two options:\n1. \nDisable Captcha for registration form\n\n2. \nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n\n\nDisable Captcha for registration form\n\nThis option allows to you to decide whether you require captcha to be displayed\nin the registration form while the person is registering.\n\n\n\nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n\nThis section allows you to filter list of attributes to be displayed in the registration form.\nYou will be able to search for the attribute and move the selected attribute by clicking on the drop down\nlist and moving to the other column by clicking on \nAdd\n or \nAdd all\n if you have selected multiple attributes.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nThe attributes that are avalaible in the Gluu Server CE is found in this page. The administration can only see the active attributes when this page is accessed. The \nShow All Attributes\n button will show the inactive attributes too. Custom attributes can be added by clicking the \nAdd Attribute\n button and filling up a simple form. \n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the mechanism used by Gluu Server CE to import users from a \nbackend LDAP/AD data source. The entire configuration is handled from this page. \nThe \nCache Refresh\n will notify the administrator of any problem with cache refresh \nthe last time it was run. The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page \nwith the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n form. The key attributes, object class and the \nsource attributes can be defined from the \nCustomer  BackendKey/Attributes\n tab. The \nbackend server address, bind DN and other information must go to the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab.\n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer\n#\n\n\nThe logs for oxauth, oxtrust, cache refresh and the tomcat log can be configured \nfrom this tab. The log paths are given with the functionality to define any new \nlog template with log file path.\n\n\nView Log File\n#\n\n\nThe log files are listed in the \nView Log File\n page under the \nAllowed Log Files\n tab. \nThe individual logs can be tailed by clicking them. The \nConfiguration\n contains the \nlast line count which will show the number of lines specified from the log in the \nTail of Log File\n tab. \nThis section is an alternative to getting into the Gluu \nchroot\n and tailing the log files.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page will give some basic information about the Gluu Server such as the \nhostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the \nbackend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page will give the certificate information for Gluu Server. \nThe issuer info along with the algorithm used and the expiry date is also available.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE contains all SAML related functionalities under the \nSAML\n tab \ndivided into outbound and inbound SAML transactions. Inbound SAML is also known as ASIMBA. \n\n\nOutbound\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTrust Relationships\n page, as the name suggests, will allow the administrator to \nview the created trust relationships (TRs) by searching using the search button. \nThere is a button to add relationship with the same name. All the available TRs can be \nsearched by using two (2) spaces in the search bar. There are some information that the \nadministrator needs to gather before creating any new TR in Gluu Server. The metadata of the \nService Provider (SP) connected using TR must be gathered along with the required attributes. \nThe creation of TR will be covered in detail later.\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is another protocol supported by Gluu Server \nCE following the \nopenID Connect specifications\n. \nThe scopes page contains the \nAdd Scope\n button which can be used to add new scopes in Gluu Server. \nAdditionally the available scopes can be searched by name or listed using two (2) spaces in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect clients are accessible from the \nClients\n page under \nOpenID Connect\n tab. \nThe structure is similar to the scopes page with the functionality to search by name or use two (2) spaces \nto list all the available clients. New clients can be added by clicking the \nAdd Client\n button.\n\n\n\n\nUMA\n#\n\n\nUMA or (User-Managed Access) is an access management protocol supported by Gluu Server.\nThe available scopes can be searched using the search bar on the top of the page. \nNew scope descriptions can be added using the \nAdd Scope Description\n button.\n\n\n\nUMA resources page also has a searchbar on the top of the page and can be used \nto search for resource sets. New resource sets can be added by clocking on the \nAdd Resource Set\n button.\n\n\n\nUsers\n#\n\n\nUsers tab allows Gluu admin to do various task, including add admin, search users, Import users from file.\n\n\nPersonal\n#\n\n\nPersonal tab allows the individual person to view his basic profile and modify certain fields.",

An example is \n/etc/certs/gplus_client_secrets.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the single steps needed to get it:\n\n\na) Log into: \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n\nb) Click \"Create project\" and enter project name\n\n\nc) Open new project \"API & auth -> Credentials\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n\n\nd) Click \"Add credential\" with type \"OAuth 2.0 client ID\"\n\n\ne) Select \"Web application\" application type\n\n\nf) Enter \"Authorized JavaScript origins\".

It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the \ngplus_local_attributes_list\n property.

It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextension_module\n - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_configuration_attribute\n - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file file\n content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n\nconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nOne simple way to test the configuration is to use oxTrust. In the\n\"Configure Authentication\" dropdown menu, select \"Google\" (or whatever\nyou entered as the \"Name\" of the custom authentication script--as the\ndefault authentication method.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you login and logout, you should be presented with a new login\nform that has the Google login button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking the Google login button, you are presented for\nauthorization--Google needs to make sure its ok to release attributes to\nthe Gluu Server:\n\n\n\n\nIf the script doesn't work, and you locked yourself out of oxTrust,\ndon't worry! You can create an LDIF file, for example \nrevert.ldif\n, to\nset back the default authentication method, like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\noxAuthenticationMode corresponds to the 'Name' of the customer\nauthentication script in oxTrust. Use \ninternal\n to revert to the\ndefault LDAP authentication. You'll have to change the \ninum\n with the\n\ninum\n of your installation. You can find it using ldapsearch like this:\n\n\nroot@gluu3-ubuntu:/opt/symas/bin# ./ldapsearch -h locahost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager,o=gluu\" -w \"{password provided during setup}\" -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" inum\n\n\n\n\n~/.pw\n is a file with your Directory Manager password. If you don't\nremember it, try to find it using \ngrep\n: \n\n\ngrep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n\n\n\n\nOnce your LDIF looks ok, then use \nldapmodify\n to revert back to\npassword authentication:\n\n\nroot@gluu3-ubuntu:/opt/symas/bin# ./ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager,o=gluu\" -w \"{password provided during setup}\" -f revert.ldif\n\n\n\n\nIf things go wrong, it can leave the sessions in your browser in a bad\nstate.

Go to Manage Custom Scripts      Click on the  Add Custom Scritp  button add-script-button    Fill up the form and add the  Google External Authenticator  Script.    You'll also need to add some custom properties:   gplus_client_secrets_file :  /etc/gluu/conf/google.json  gplus_deployment_type : enroll  gplus_remote_attributes_list : email, given_name, family_name, and locale   gplus_local_attributes_list : uid, mail, givenName, sn, cn, preferredLanguage    gplus_client_secrets_file  - It is a mandatory property that holds\n   the path to the application configuration file downloaded from Google\n   console for application. An example is  /etc/certs/gplus_client_secrets.json .    These are the single steps needed to get it:  a) Log into:  https://console.developers.google.com/project  b) Click \"Create project\" and enter project name  c) Open new project \"API & auth -> Credentials\" menu item in configuration navigation tree  d) Click \"Add credential\" with type \"OAuth 2.0 client ID\"  e) Select \"Web application\" application type  f) Enter \"Authorized JavaScript origins\". It should be CE server DNS\n       name, for example  https://gluu.info .  g) Click \"Create\" and Click \"OK\" in next dialog  h) Click \"Download JSON\" in order to download\n        gplus_client_secrets.json  file.  Also it is mandatory to enable Google+ API:  a) Log into  https://console.developers.google.com/project  b) Select project and enter project name  c) Open new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree  d) Click \"Google+ API\"  e) Click \"Enable API\" button    gplus_deployment_type  - Specify the deployment mode. It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.    gplus_remote_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the  gplus_local_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    gplus_local_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the gplus_remote_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    extension_module  - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:        # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False   gplus_client_configuration_attribute  - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override gplus_client_secrets_file file  content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate  gplus_client_secrets.json \nconfiguration.",

Our Sample \n\nTwilio script\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI\n\n\nNavigate to \"Configuration\" on the Menu panel to the left\n\n\nSelect Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click on \"Add custom script configuration\"\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, Programming Language (Python will be by default, \nmay be in future Java or JavaSCript will be added)\n\n\nSelect the Level needed to set the security level to.\n\n\nSelect Location Type from the script to be executed.\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type required for the authentication.\n\n\nDefine Custom property which is provided by Twilio and can be noted down from \nTwilio account page of the signed up user. \n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the added custom script.\n\n\nScroll down to the end of the update and click on Update button to submit the form. \n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, click on Manage Authenticaion on the Menu Panel to left. \n\n\nSelect \"Default Authentication Method\" tab and change the oxTrust authentication mode \nto \"Twilio\" or \"Name of the script\" from the drop down.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.\n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.\n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n\n\nThe most important method to implement is obviously the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.\n\n\nBelow are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", \n<key>\n). Where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n\n\nUserService.instance()\n \nGets the user login instance\n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n\n\nTo access  information from requestParameters in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .\n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n\n\ngetAttribute():\n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n\nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get(\n<key>\n). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n\n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample \n\nDuo script\n,\n\n\nDuo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n\n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.\n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n\n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.\n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get(\n<key>\n), where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n\n\nSaving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.\n\n\nRetriving and passing values between the authentication steps:\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.\n\n\nCustom Properties\n#\n\n\nSometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot. If administrators are\nnot allowed to modify the script, Custom Property feature can be used, as illustrated in below screenshot:\n\n\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"\n\").getValue2\"():\n\n\nTo access this information in your script with \n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2()\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve.\n\n\nReturning a message to the user\n#\n\n\nIt is possible to use the Context to return a message to the\nuser, which could be especially useful if an error occurs, or if\nrequired to have some kind of user action.\n\n\nAdding Libraries\n#\n\n\nPure Python libraries, can be added to \n/opt/gluu/python/libs\n, jar files can be added to  \n/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/lib/ext\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\njar files should be added within chroot. \n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nWhen the scripting is done, you can test the script by print\nthe statments to oxtrust.log under \n/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs/oxtrust.log\n. \n\n\nAnd by prefix the logs, will help to find the script at ease\nusing tail command \ntail -f | grep <prefix>\n, the prefix logs will\nprovide the script output while one trys to login using the script.\n\n\nIn the Twilio test script, a specific method called\n\nprintOut\n has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.\n\n\nAlso, remember that putting all the code in a \ntry / catch\n\nis a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions. Since during\ndebugging, those exception may provide a hint pointing what causes the issue.\n\n\nFurther logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using oxauth_script.log and oxauth.log\nunder\n/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs/\n which is within the chroot.\n\n\nReverting Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not unlikely that one may get locked out of Gluu\nServer, while testing the authentication script.\n\n\nIf there is any problem in it. In such a case the following\nmethod can be used to revert back the older authentication method. \n\n\nAs a secondary option, InPrivate or Incognito or Private Browser from various Browsers can be used.",

This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample  Duo script ,  Duo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".  getExtraParametersForStep():  If required to save session variables between steps, use the  getExtraParametersForStep  method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.  getPageForStep():  If required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the getPageForStep  which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.  session_attributes.get(): \nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get( <key> ), where  <key>  is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")",

Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. Including Passport.js in the Gluu Server will allow an admin to offer many authentication strategies to end users, including social login at large consumer IDPs like Google, Facebook, etc.\n\n\nWhy Passport.js Authenticaion\n#\n\n\n\n\nTo create Node-Passport server which will provide social network authentication APIs for Gluu server.\n\n\nTo create Gluu server interception scripts for authentication of users which will consume Node-Passport server api.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n#\n\n\nNode-Passport server authenticates users for all the social networks like: google+, facebook, twitter etc. Node-Passport uses passport authentication middleware for social network authentication. All the node js api are secured with JWT(JSON Web Token) so that all the requests to node js server are authenticated and can be trusted by the application.\n\n\nGluu server has only one interception script for all the social network providers which will call node js server for authenticating users to respective social network provider. The users will be added to Gluu server if the user does not present in the LDAP server of Gluu and if user does not exists then user will be added to server.\n\n\nSequence Diagram\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu server calls Node-Passport server for JWT token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server generates a JWT token and provides it in response to Gluu server.\n\n\nGluu server requests Node-Passport server with JWT token to authenticate user for a social network provider.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user to social media authentication provider.\n\n\nAfter successful authentication of user, social network will callback Node-Passport server along with user details and access token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user back to Gluu server with user details and access token.\n\n\nGluu server\u2019s interception script will check if the user exists in LDAP server and if user exists then user will be logged into the system and if not, then it will create new user with the required details and logs user into the system.\n\n\n\n\nSETUP Passport.js with Gluu\n#\n\n\nDuring installation of the Gluu Server select \nyes\n to install Passport.js when prompted.\n\n\n\n\nClick on Manage Custom Scripts under configuration tab on the main menu.\n\n\nEnable passport script in Person Authentication Tab.\n\n\nClick on update at the end of the page.\n\n\nEnable uma authorization policy in uma authorization policy tab.\n\n\nClick on update.\n\n\nTo set the strategies from Configuration > Manage Authentication > Default Authenticaion\n\n\nUnder Default Authenticaion tab, change Authentication mode to passport\n\n\nChange passport support to enabled.\n\n\nOnce Passport support is enabled and updated, Passport Authentication Method will appear in the next tab.\n\n\nClick on the Passport Authenticaion Method, and set the strategies as follows,The values for Strategy field for common providers are:\n\n\ngoogle for GPlus Authentication\n\n\ntwitter for Twitter Authentication\n\n\nlinkedin for LinkedIn Authentication\n\n\ngithub for Github Authentication\n\n\nfacebook for Facebook Authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then add the strategy details like clientID and clientSecret.\n            clientID and clientSecret are details obtained from the provider, after the app is created in the provider form.\n\n\nOnce the configuration and settings are done, restart the passport service or Gluu Server.\n        a. Login to chroot\n        b. Enter below command to stop.\n        \nservice passport stop\n\n        c. Below command to start.\n        \nservice passport start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nAll the strategies name and Field name should follow the case. As these are case sensitive. ie. Google Strategy should have \"google\" as the strategy name and clientID should be small \"c\".\n\n\n\n\nHow to create a new app to use for Passport server?\n#\n\n\nEvery provider has different protocols and ways to create the app. We will look at one of the most common providers \"facebook\" and create a new app.\n\n\n\n\nLogin to https://developers.facebook.com\n\n\nClick on Add a new App from My Apps dropdown\n\n\nFill the required details and click the create Create App ID button to create the app.\n\n\nClick on the dashboard menu and get the clientID and clientSecret which can be used with the passport.\n\n\nClick on settings menu and put the domain of your gluu server in the App Domains field.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If there is a filed for Authorized redirect URIs, make sure the Authorized redirect URIs list of your app contains the passport strategy's callback. If your gluu server points to https://example.gluu.org and the strategy is facebook, the list of Authorized redirect URIs should contain https://example.gluu.org/passport/auth/facebook/callback.\nMake sure the  Authorized redirect URIs list of your app contains the passport strategy's callback.\nIf your gluu server points to https://example.gluu.org and the strategy is facebook, the list of Authorized redirect URIs should contain https://example.gluu.org/passport/auth/facebook/callback.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n#\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe node installation is already installed when passport is selected during the installation of Gluu 3.0.0 CE Server.\n\n\n\n\nNode-Passport server requires npm and NodeJS to be installed on the system.\n\n\nFor installing node and npm please refer to \nthis guide\n.\n\n\nClone the repository and move to server directory and hit:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\nThis will install all the dependencies of the server. To start the server move to the server directory and hit\n\n\nnode app\n\n\nJWT\n#\n\n\nJSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.\n\n\nJSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:\n- Header\n- Payload\n- Signature\n\n\nTherefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.\nxxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz\n\n\nAll the three parts are then Base64Url encoded to form JSON Web Token.\n\n\nThe output is three Base64 strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.\n\n\nThe following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.\n\n\nIf you want to play with JWT and put these concepts to practice, you can use jwt.io Debugger to decode, verify and generate JWTs.\n\n\nExample of encoded and decoded JWT\n#\n\n\n\n\nWhenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, it should send the JWT, here in our case in route url. Therefore the route or api call should look like the following.\n\n\nhttps://urltorouteorresource/JWT\n\n\nThis is a stateless authentication mechanism as the user state is never saved in the server memory. The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the API parameter, and if there is a valid token, the user will be allowed.\n\n\nWhat data will be persist?\n#\n\n\nAll the data that are received from the social network like name, email etc will be stored. If all the required details for creating a user are not available from the social network then user will be asked to enter all the required details. Currently email is the only required field.\n\n\nHow Node-Passport server will fit in Gluu server?\n#\n\n\nDuring the installation of Gluu server we can setup node server as well. We can create a vagrant script to set up whole Node-Passport environment.\n\n\nHow does Gluu server specify which passport strategy it wants?\n#\n\n\nThere will be single page for the authentication with different buttons which will call different endpoints on Node-Passport server. For example twitter button will call the twitter strategy of Node-Passport server for twitter authentication.\n\n\nHow to add new strategies to Passport server?\n#\n\n\nFind an npm module that fits best for the strategy that you want to add.\nLet's start with an example. In this example we will consider adding facebook strategy.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add facebook strategy, search for passport-facebook npm module where you can select the npm module and then add the module to passport server.\n\n\nLet's say we found this module \"passport-facebook\" and want to use this module in for facebook authentication, install the module in passport app by executing \nnpm install passport-facebook --save\n to install the module and also save the dependency to the passport server.\n\n\nConfigure the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the strategy\n#\n\n\nAll the strategies are been configured in the folder server/auth/*.js.\nWe need to create new file named with the strategy name. Our strategy is facebook so we can create new file named facebook.js and configure the strategy.\n\n\nvar passport = require('passport');\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;\n\nvar setCredentials = function(credentials) {\n    var callbackURL = global.applicationHost.concat(\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\");\n    passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({\n            clientID: credentials.clientID,\n            clientSecret: credentials.clientSecret,\n            callbackURL: callbackURL,\n            enableProof: true,\n            profileFields: ['id', 'name', 'displayName', 'email']\n        },\n        function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {\n            var userProfile = {\n                id: profile._json.id,\n                name: profile.displayName,\n                username: profile.username || profile._json.id,\n                email: profile._json.email,\n                givenName: profile._json.first_name,\n                familyName: profile._json.last_name,\n                provider: profile.provider,\n                accessToken: accessToken\n            };\n            return done(null, userProfile);\n        }\n    ));\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    passport: passport,\n    setCredentials: setCredentials\n};\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the facebook strategy configured. For facebook the required parameters are clientID, clientSecret and callbackURL. You can search for more configurations depending on the requirements and configure accordingly.\n\n\nThe function setCredentials is used to configure the strategy of the credentials of this strategy are been received. The parameter credentials holds the values that are stored in the oxTrust\n\n\nThe parameter callbackURL should point to the callback route that we will configure in step 4. As we are configuring facebook strategy, the callbackURL can be set to \n\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\"\n according the the convention of the app. You can customise the callbackURL but it is recommended not to change the convention.\n\n\nThe callback function has different number of parameters and data in those parameters which are required to be mapped to the userProfile keys which are \nid, name, username, email, givenName, familyName, provider, accessToken\n. Here id and provider params are must. Provider param holds the value of the provider, i.e for facebook the provider value will be facebook etc. In most cases the value of provider is received in the user claims itself.\n\n\nThen export the strategy that we configured and also the setCredentials method which will be used to set the details of the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy\n#\n\n\nWe are going to set the routes for the strategy that we are going to configure.\nFirst require the strategy that we configured in the previous step.\n\n\nvar passportFacebook = require('../auth/facebook').passport;\n\n\n\n\nHere \nrequire('../auth/facebook').passport\n will include the passport strategy that we have configured.\n\n\nThen add the routes for the strategy. First we are going to register the callback route and then the authenticate route.\n\n\nThe authenticate route first validated the jwt token that is been sent by Gluu server to passport server. If the JWT is valid then the user is redirected to the strategy and user can be authenticated there and the response of the user authentication is redirected to callback route.\n\n\nIf the callback routes receives the user data then user is been redirected to Gluu.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nscope value can be set from the strategy itself it it supports that or you can set the scope value here too.\n\n\nThe callbackResponse method return the control to Gluu server and user is been enrolled in the system.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n#\n\n\nIn this step we are going to call the setCredentials method of the strategy that we have created.\n\n\nGo to the file configureStrategies.js in auth folder of passport server and require the strategy that we have created.\n\n\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('./facebook');\n\n\n\n\nAnd then in setConfiguratins function, call the setCredentials method if the strategy data is received.\n\n\n//FacebookStrategy\nif (data.passportStrategies.facebook) {\n    logger.log('info', 'Facebook Strategy details received');\n    logger.sendMQMessage('info: Facebook Strategy details received');\n    FacebookStrategy.setCredentials(data.passportStrategies.facebook);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will configure the passport strategy if the details of the strategy are received from passport API.\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n#\n\n\nSo far the passport server is ready with the new strategy that we have created, but to call the strategy we need to add a button which calls the new strategy.\n\n\n<a data-p=\"facebook\" class=\"provider\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" style=\"height:40px; width:120px\">\n    <img alt=\"facebook\" src=\"img/facebook.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\"></img>\n</a>\n\n\n\n\nHere the data-p and class=\"provider\" are required to call the strategy. the data-p attribute should hold the value of the route that we created in routes.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nIn order to call the Strategy, the request URL to call the API must match the route that we configured.",

The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded, and it is signed with a secret.  If you want to play with JWT and put these concepts to practice, you can use jwt.io Debugger to decode, verify and generate JWTs.",

This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Method:\n If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the \nCopy\n  Method\n from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes Mapping\n#\n\n\nWhen the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nIn the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.\n\n\nThe Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPooling Interval (Minutes):\n This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript File Name:\n The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Folder:\n Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings \nUpdated at the last run\n and\n    \nProblems at the last run\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Count:\n This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM.

This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved Script File Name location:\n New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate and Validate Script:\n This button is used to test the\n    operation and integrity of any custom script such as a Jython Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport People from file\n#\n\n\n\n\nGluu Server allows the administrator to add users from files. This can be accessed from the \nImport People\n button from the \nUsers\n menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd\n button to select the file from which the users will be imported. This feature has been tested with a \nxls\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the \nValidate\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nImport\n button to complete the import of users.\n\n\n\n\nFile Scructure\n#\n\n\nThe file needs to contain the following fields from which the user data will be pulled.

Since\noxTrust user registration cannot add users to a backend LDAP or Active\nDirectory server, self-registration will only be effective if GluuLDAP\nis used for authentication of users.\n\n\nBY default a a limited number of attribute is present in default\nself-registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added\nin Registration Management of Organization Configuration\nThe oxTrust component provides a very basic user registration service for \nthe people to sign-up for an account on the Gluu Server. This service is \ndisabled by default. The \nUser Registration\n custom script  is used to enable the \nregistration feature.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen possible, we recommend handling user registration in your app locally, then pushing the information to the Gluu Server via SCIM 2.0. This will give you much more control and flexibility in defining the exact registration process. Also,\n\n\n\n\nfrequently oxTrust is not Internet facing--it was primarily designed as an interface for admins.\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nNavigate to the custom scripts section of the Admin Panel. Click on the \nConfiguration menu and then\nManage Custom Scripts`.\n\n\n\n\nThe tabs near the top of the page can be used to navigate to different custom scripts. We are concerned about \nthe \nUser Registration\n tab.\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nenable_user\n value to to \ntrue\n so that the user can login as soon as \nthe registration is complete, which sets the default status value. You may want to leave this to \nfalse\n if you \nwant to manually review user registrations before allowing them.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nEnable\n checkbox at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\nUser Registration\n\n\nThe users can register through the user registration link usually available at \n<hostname>/identity/register\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 User Add/Delete\n#\n\n\nThis section outlines how to add/remove user from Gluu Server CE using \nSCIM-Client\n.\n\n\nAdd User\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods to add users:\n\n\n\n\nJSON Sting\n\n\nUser Object\n\n\n\n\nRequired Parameters\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserName\n\n\nThe intended username for the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngivenName\n\n\nThe first name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamilyName\n\n\nThe last name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplayName\n\n\nThe formatted first name followed by last name\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroups\n\n\nOptional parameter if the user is added to any specific group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON String\n#\n\n\nThe user is added using a JSON object string using the required parameters; however it is possible to add more parameters.

            "text": "SAML\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign On (SSO) or traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction, the SP redirects the user to the designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. The IDP will ask for the username and password for the user and up on successful authentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. The requirement for the IDP is a trust relationship (TR) set up beforehand with the SP. The next section covers how to set up a TR in Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor any SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created with the IDP.\n\n\n\n\nTrust Relationship Requirements\n#\n\n\nTrust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.\n\n\nMetadata of the SP\n\nMetadata is a XML file which has configuration data used to provision any website (SP) or IDP (Gluu Server) to communicate with each other. It is interchangeable between the IDP and the SP.\n\n\nWebsites (SP) can provide metadata via URL or as a separate file.\n\n\nRequired Attributes\n\nEvery organization has their own policy to release/share attributes with\nany IDP or SP. The oxTrust GUI supports both preconfigured and custom attribute\nRelease to the SP. The administrator only needs to click on the desired \nattribute and it will be released to the SP.\n\n\nSSO Testing Endpoint\n\nEvery website (SP) should have both a staging and a production URI\nendpoint which can be checked for SSO, where the user will access to log\ninto that SP.\n\n\nCreate a Trust Relationship\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to SAML \u2192 Trust Relationships\n\n\nClick on \u201cAdd Relationship\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new page will appear. Here, as a Gluu Server administrator you need\n  to provide all the information regarding the SP to establish Trust\n  Relationship from Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)\n\n\nDescription\n: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.\n\n\nMetadata Type\n: Depending on trusted party\u2019s metadata (SP), there are four available types in Gluu Server\n\n\nFile\n: If SP has uploadable metadata in XML format, this option works best.\n\n\nURI\n: If the metadata of SP has URI link and accessible from the internet, Gluu Server Administrator can use this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased\n: The attributes that are required for the SP must be in this pane. The required attributes can be selected from the left side pane with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.\nThe TR is added by clicking on the \nAdd\n button located in the lower left side of the page.\n\n\n\n\nRelying Party Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe Relying Party must be configured for some SPs. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox \nConfigure specific Relying Party\n must be checked.\n\n\n\n\nThe checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to configure relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.\n\n\n\n\nFederation Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the SP is part of any identity federation such as InCommon Federation, then the administrator must add the federation as a SP in Gluu Server. This will allow the administrator to add SPs under the federation easily from a TR. The requirement of a federation TR created using the general TR is a must. The example below shows an administrator adding a TR for InCommon Federation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, the SPs under the federation can be added by selecting the Federation from the \nFederation Name\n drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.\n\n\n\n\nInbound SAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server uses an open source product called Asimba to achieve inbound SAML. Asimba allows websites to use a single IDP for SSO even when the organization has multiple trusted IDPs. Please see the \nAsimba website\n for more information.\n\n\nGluu Server is shipped with the SAML Script which simplifies the process of using SAML Proxy. The SAML proxy configuration is made easy from the oxTrust admin interface. This section provides a step-by-step method of configuring the proxy with two (2) IDPs and a single SP. The administrator can add multiple IDPs or SPs if required using the same method. However, it is mandatory that all the SPs and IDPs are connected to the Asimba server, or the IDP that has the Asimba module enabled.\ni\n\n\nRequired Setup\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup hostname\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://sp.gluu.org/protected/print.py\n\n\nThis is a shibboleth SP connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a Gluu Server SAML IdP with Asimba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://nest.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a second Gluu Server SAML IdP connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDescription of SAML Authentication Module is available here: https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/tree/master/Server/integrations/saml\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Setup Details\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server setup with the hostname \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n must be setup with Asimba.

            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0. \nOpenID Connect is a specific implementation of OAuth 2.0 \nwhere the identity provider holds protected resources that a \nthird-party application needs to access on behalf of a person. \nOpenID Connect allows relying parties to verify the identity of, and obtain information about a person requesting to access the applications protected resources. \n\n\nJargon\n#\n\n\nIn OpenID Connect the key entities include:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nend user\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 resource owner) whose user information the application needs to access.\n\n\n\n\nThe end user wants to login to an application using an existing account at an OpenID Connect identity provider (OP).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelying Party (RP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 client) needs access to the end user's protected user information.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, an online chat application needs to know who is accessing the application in order to present the correct user account and contacts. \n\n\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Provider (OP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 authorization server and also resource server) that holds the user information and grants access.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is an OpenID Provider. The OP holds information about the user and allows the end user or the organization (depending on configuration) to consent to providing the RP with access to user information. OpenID Connect defines a unique identification for an account (subject identifier + issuer identifier), and the RP can use this as a key to its own user profile. \n\n\nThe relying party can verify claims about the identity of the end user, and log the user out at the end of a session. OpenID Connect also makes it possible to discover the OpenID Provider for an end user, and to register relying party client applications dynamically. OpenID connect services are built on OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Token (JWT), WebFinger and Well-Known URIs.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Support in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a \nfully certified OpenID Connect Provider (OP)\n. As an OpenID Provider, the Gluu Server enables OpenID Connect relying parties (clients) to discover its capabilities, handle both dynamic and static registration of relying parties, respond to relying party requests with authorization codes, access tokens, and user information according to the Authorization Code and Implicit flows of OpenID Connect, and manages sessions.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Implicit Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Implicit Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant. The main difference between the OAuth and OpenID Connect implicit flows lie in the use of the id_token, which must be returned in Connect. The id_token adds additional security to the transaction. For more information, read the \nOpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's guide\n.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant. The authorization code flow is more secure than the implicit flow because the tokens are never exposed to the web browser and possibly other malicious applications with access to the browser. As with the implicit flow the extra securuty in Connect's authorization code flow stems from the id_token. \n\n\nOpenID Connect Hybrid Flow\n#\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nThe first thing you want to know about any OAuth 2.0 API is where the\nendpoints are (i.e. what are the URIs where you call the APIs).\nOpenID Connect provides a very simple mechanism to accomplish this: \n\nOpenID Connect Discovery\n.\n\n\nIn order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect\nservices for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is.\nOpenID Connect uses \nWebFinger\n\nto locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.\n\n\nOnce the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information\nfor the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document,\nincluding its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.\n\n\nSample Discovery Request\n#\n\n\nIf you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following\nWebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1

\"https://idp.gluu.org\"\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Issuer location discovered, the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be retrieved.\n\n\nThe RP makes the following request to the Issuer \nhttps://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n to obtain its\nConfiguration information:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1

The specification has the relying party monitor session state using an invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage API.\n\n\nHowever, be forewarned that there is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all requirements for all domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession\nManagement\n is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return \nIMG\n HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side\nlogout, the domain admin can use \nCustom Logout scripts\n. This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.\n\n\nThe key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Relying Party Registration\n#\n\n\nRelying parties can register with the Gluu Server both statically, by the Gluu Server admin, and dynamically, as specified by OpenID Connect Discovery. To allow dynamic registration, you register an initial OAuth 2.0 client that other relying parties can use to get access tokens for registration. You can also enable OpenID Connect relying parties to register dynamically without having to provide an access token. If dynamic registration is enabled, make sure to limit or throttle registrations as it could be used as a form of DDOS.\n\n\nClient Code\n#\n\n\nAlthough you can use generic OAuth 2.0 client libraries to call OpenID Connect endpoints, you would have to implement code to take advantage of some of OpenID Connect's features. For example, there is no id_token in OAuth 2.0, so you won't find any code for id_token validation in an OAuth 2.0 library. A good OpenID Connect client will do much of the heavy lifting for you. \n\n\nJavaScript Client\n#\n\n\nA JavaScript client is one of the easiest ways to use OpenID Connect, although it's not the most secure. The client we recommend was forked from a sample application written to demonstrate how easy it is to use Connect. Gluu forked the code, and has enhanced it since the time of its original publishing. The project can be found on \nGithub\n.\n\n\nIt's not a fancy app--it sends the person to the authorization endpoint to be authenticated, and then prints the claims tha are returned in the id_token. Currently the client does not handle dynamic client registration. \n\n\nYou'll have to add the client manually to the Gluu Server via the GUI. When completing the \nadd client\n form, you can use the following configuration:\n\n\nClient Name: Implicit Test Client\nresponse_type: token id_token\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nSubject Type: public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: token id_token\nGrant Types: implicit\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have registered the client in the Gluu Server, all you need to do is update the \nclient_id\n, \nredirect_uri\n, and \nproviderInfo\n values in the login page html. Assuming you've checked out the project into a web accessible folder, then navigate to the page and test! \n\n\nServer-Side libraries\n#\n\n\nMany applications are \"server-side\", meaning the web page displays content but most of the dynamic business logic resides on the web server. The OpenID Foundation maintains a list of client libraries on \ntheir website\n. However, our experience has been that the quality of these libraries varies widely. Some are not well documented, other are not updated frequently, and some do not implement essential security features available in OpenID Connect. In addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes difficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called \noxd\n.  \n\n\noxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per day per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on \nGitHub\n, and there are free open source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, Ruby, Perl and Go. There are also plugins available for several popular open source applications.\n\n\nWatch the oxd demo\n.\n\n\nGet an oxd license for free\n\n\nApache HTTPD module\n#\n\n\nA popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server filter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that connection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager. \n\n\nOne of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code. \n\n\nOne of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called \nmod_auth_openidc\n. It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source. \n\n\nNote: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar \nLua implementation\n to make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS. \n\n\nAppAuth for Mobile Applications\n#\n\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Connect is to authenticate people from a mobile application. The IETF draft \n\"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"\n provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).\n\n\nIn 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for \nAndroid\n and \niOS\n. The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier). \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is the only free open source OpenID Connect Provider that currently supports AppAuth. \n\n\noxAuth RP\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server ships with an optional OpenID Connect relying party web application, which is handy for testing.  It's called oxauth-rp. During Gluu Server setup, you'll be asked if you want to install it--which you should on a development environment. It will be deployed on \nhttps://<hostname>/oxauth-rp\n. Using this tool you can exercise all of the OpenID Connect API's, including discovery, client registration, authorization, token, userinfo, and end_session.",

The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager.   One of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code.   One of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called  mod_auth_openidc . It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source.

The IETF draft  \"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"  provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).  In 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for  Android  and  iOS . The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier).

            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nGluu Server supports only UMA protection for SCIM endpoints from version 2.4.0 onwards. \nA machine based authorization method is used to obtain the access tokens. SCIM/UMA is built\ninto the Gluu Server CE and does not require any special package or installation. Please checkout \n\nInstallation Guide\n for installation instructions.\n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\n\n\nInstall Gluu Server CE following the \nInstallation Guide\n and \nremember to install \nAsimba\n while running the setup script.  The setup script prepares the \nconfiguration necessary for SCIM UMA RS endpoints and SCIM UMA RP client \nand \nthis template\n \nis used. \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The JWKS for RS and RP clients are put into the \n./output/scim.ldif\n file ready for SCIM configuration.\nThe \nsetup.properties.file\n contains the RS and RP JWKS in Base64 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following command to extract OpenID SCIM RS and RP Client ID\n\ncat setup.properties.last | grep \"scim_rs_client_id\\|scim_rp_client_id\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UMA SCIM client requires JWKS, so the setup script extracts the JWKS from \nsetup.properties.last\n and puts it into the \n./output/scim-rp.jks\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n For versions before v2.4.4, the JWKS is put in the \n./output/scim-rp-openid-keys.json\n file instead.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nEnable SCIM from Organization Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust SCIM UMA configuration is automatically updated while running the \nsetup.py\n and the correct values are setup \nin the \noxtrust-config.json\n file.\n\n\n\n\n  \"umaIssuer\":\"https://%(hostname)s\",\n  \"umaClientId\":\"%(scim_rs_client_id)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyId\":\"\",\n  \"umaResourceId\":\"1447184268430\",\n  \"umaScope\":\"https://%(hostname)s/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/uma/scopes/scim_access\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStoreFile\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_fn)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStorePassword\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_pass_encoded)s\",\n\n\n\n\n\n\numaClientKeyId\n can be updated with the \nalias\n from \nscim-rp.jks\n file; if it is not updated, the first key from the file is used automatically.\n\n\n\n\nTesting SCIM UMA\n#\n\n\nThe following is a sample code that can be run to test the configured SCIM UMA Gluu CE. It uses \nSCIM-Client\n, a Java library also developed by Gluu intended for client applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Maven, below is how to add SCIM-Client to your project:\n\n\n\n\n<repositories>\n  <repository>\n    <id>gluu</id>\n    <name>Gluu repository</name>\n    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>\n  </repository>\n</repositories>\n...\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>\n  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>\n  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with Release v2.4.2, an SCIM-Client must be used on a matching Gluu CE.

The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored in LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Jetty configuration and into the custom authentication script. It is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.\n\n\n\n\nHow to set the port to something other than 443\n#\n\n\nPorts other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server\n\n\n\n\nHow to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section. By default the Primary Key and Local Key are set to \nuid\n. Set those va    lues to \nmail\n and now your Gluu Server will expect email as the identifier instead of username.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will want to update your IDP login page to display \nEmail Address\n as the requested identifier. In order to do that you need to modify the \nlogin.xhtm    l\n file, which is located in \n/opt/tomcat/webapps/oxauth/\n. Insert \nEmail Address\n as the value for \noutputLabel\n; this snippet is under the \ndialog\n class.

Therefore to fix this issue:\n\n\n\n\nChange the DNS inside the container by editing the \n/etc/resolv.conf\n file and adding the DNS used by your organization\n\n\n\n\nForgot the admin password!\n#\n\n\nGluu Server stores the admin password in the file \n/install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n under the\nproperty \nldapPass\n. Retrieve the data using the following command:\n\n\n# grep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/*.last\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended to remove the file from any production environment or encrypt the file\n\n\n\n\nRevert Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not unlikely that you will lock yourself out of Gluu Server while testing the authentication script, if there is any problem in it. In such a case the following method can be used to revert back the older authentication method.\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to collect the \ninum\n for the Gluu Server installation.\n\n\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory \nmanager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" \noxAuthenticationMode\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nLDIF\n file with the contents below:\n\n\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, we shall call this file \nchangeAuth.ldif\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Replace the \ninum\n from the example above with the \ninum\n of the Gluu Server from the \nldapsearch\n command.\n\n\n\n\nReplace the the authentication mode using \nldapmodify\n command.\n\n\n\n\n`/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/changeAuth.ldif\n\n\nNo admin access after Cache Refresh?\n#\n\n\nAdd the password for your admin account to \n~/.pw\n and then use the commands below to add yourself as an admin.\n\n\n# set this to your actual user name\nexport newgluuadmin='myusername'\n\n# this is the file that will hold the info to be imported\nexport ldiffile='addManagers.ldif'\n\n# run this and verify that the output is for your account\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.\n 3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nuid: myusername\ngivenName: John\nsn: Doe\ncn: John Doe\n\n\n\n\nNow you can run these commands to make the file above:\n\n\nhead -n1 /opt/opendj/ldif/groups.ldif > $ldiffile\necho 'changetype: modify' >> $ldiffile\necho 'add: member' >> $ldiffile\necho \"member: $(/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn |grep -A1 dn |cut -d ' ' -f 2- | sed 'N;s/\\n//')\" >> $ldiffile\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting ldif will look like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\n\n\n\n\nOnce the ldif looks right, run this to grant your account admin rights in Gluu:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -f addManagers.ldif\n\n\n\n\nLog into the web interface and pick up where you left off :)",

If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrant_types\n\n\nA list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:\nauthorization_code\nThe Authorization Code Grant Type\nimplicit\nThe Implicit Grant Type\nrefresh_token\nThe Refresh Token Grant Type\nThe following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list:\ncode: authorization_code\nid_token: implicit\ntoken id_token: implicit\ncode id_token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token id_token: authorization_code, implicit\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplication_type\n\n\nKind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontacts\n\n\ne-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_name\n\n\nName of the Client to be presented to the End-User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogo_uri\n\n\nURL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_uri\n\n\nURL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolicy_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntos_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks_uri\n\n\nURL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400|invalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

possession of a permission ticket and an AAT for this\nauthorization server, the client asks the authorization server to give\nit authorization data corresponding to that permission ticket. It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.\n\n\nIf the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.\n\n\nIn circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt. All such processes are outside the scope of this\nspecification.\n\n\nURL\n\n    http://gluu.org/requester/perm\n\n\nParameters\n\n- body\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|body|false||\nRptAuthorizationRequest\n|\n- header\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|Authorization|false||string|\n|Host|false||string|\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n403|Forbidden.

One of these registered Redirection URI values must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request    response_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 response_type values that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token    grant_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are: authorization_code The Authorization Code Grant Type implicit The Implicit Grant Type refresh_token The Refresh Token Grant Type The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list: code: authorization_code id_token: implicit token id_token: implicit code id_token: authorization_code, implicit code token: authorization_code, implicit code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit    application_type  Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.    contacts  e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.    client_name  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.    logo_uri  URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.    client_uri  URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.",

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

SCIM uses a REST API for operations which are disabled by default. The support for SCIM must be enabled from the oxTrust admin interface. \nSCIM is enabled from the Organization Configuration in the oxTrust administration interface. Please navigate to \nOrganization Configuration\n --> \nSystem Configuration\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlease navigate down the page to find \nSCIM Support\n in the \nSYstem Configuration\n page and select \nEnabled\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Endpoints\n#\n\n\nSCIM uses REST API for the operations which are covered in short in this section. There are two versions of the SCIM API each with its own specification. This usage of SCIM requires advanced level knowledge of HTTP GET and POST commands and not recommended for entry level users.\n\n\nThe SCIM 1.1 is governed by the \nSCIM:Protocol 1.1\n document and SCIM 2.0 is governed by the \nSCIM:Core Schema\n & \nSCIM:Protocol\n. As it is mentioned before, the specifications define an API, the operations are performed through endpoints. There are three endpoints that are available in Gluu Server SCIM:\n\n\n\n\nUser Endpoint\n\n\nGroup Endpoint\n\n\nBulk Operation Endpoint\n\n\n\n\nThe supported operations are given later in this document.\n\n\nSCIM 1.1\n#\n\n\nThe endpoints URLS are incomplete withour the hostname.

Please remember to go through the specifications before using SCIM.\n\n\nEndpoint: User & Group\n#\n\n\nThe userinfo endpoint is given above in \nSection SCIM 1.1\n. The example below shows the userinfo endpoint for a Gluu Server with hostname \nidp.gluu.org\n:\n\n\nhttps://idp.gluu.org/host/seam/resource/restv1/scim/v1/Users{rsid}\n\n\n\n\nThe groups endpoint is given in \nSection SCIM 1.1\n.
