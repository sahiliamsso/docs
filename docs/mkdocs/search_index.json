The most common use case for the Gluu Server is Single \nSign-On (SSO). Other common use cases include mobile authentication, \nAPI access management, two-factor authentication, customer identity\nand access management (CIAM), and identity federation. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a container distribution composed of software\nwritten by Gluu and incorporated from other open source projects. Gluu\nprojects are frequently prefixed with \nox\n, which is our open source\nhandle. Any code in the Gluu Server that we wrote is MIT license, \nand is available on \nGithub\n. \n\n\nSaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more \nsecure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. \nBecause there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to \n\"top down\" implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why\nopen standards are so important for IAM. Also, we don't want to lock you into \nthe Gluu Server!\n\n\nWhile there are many open protocols for IAM, Gluu focuses on just a few. \nConsolidation saves money, and one-off integrations should be avoided. \nOur goal was to support the most widely adopted older protocols, and the \nmost promising new protocols. \n\n\nCurrently the Gluu Server supports the following open web standards for authentication, authorization, and identity management:\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0    \n\n\nSAML 2.0   \n\n\nOpenID Connect    \n\n\nUser Managed Access (UMA)    \n\n\nSimple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM)    \n\n\nFIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    \n\n\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   \n\n\n\n\nIf this is your first exposure to the Gluu Server, welcome to the \ncommunity! We want to see the ecosystem flourish, and ultimately to make \nthe Internet a safer, more privacy protected place. In order to do that, \nwe believe we need to keep the Gluu Server free, so all kinds of \norganizations can use, contribute and benefit from the software. We \ncouldn't do it without you! \n\n\nThese docs are not perfect! Please help us make them so by submitting\nany improvements to our \nDocumentation Github\n!\nIf you're a Github pro, submit a pull request. If not, just open an issue\non any typos, bugs, or improvements you'd like to see. We need your\nhelp... even if you're not a coder, you can contribute! \n\n\noxd Client Software\n#\n\n\nGluu offers commercial client software, called \noxd\n, to make securing applications easier. Your application can use any client software that implements the open standards the Gluu Server supports. But you may want to consider using oxd for the following reasons:\n\n\n(1). oxd is super-easy and fun to use; \n\n\n(2). We keep updating oxd to address the latest security knowledge; \n\n\n(3). We can provide more complete end-to-end support if we know both \nthe client and server software;\n\n\n(4). oxd subscriptions help support this project, \nso you can see more enhancements faster; \n\n\n(5). There are oxd libraries for Php, Python,\nJava, Node, Ruby, C#, Perl and Go; \n\n\n(6). There are oxd plugins for many popular open source projects like Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, OpenCart,\nSugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Roundcube, Shopify, Kong and many more are being added! Next on the list are MatterMost, RocketChat, NextCloud, and \nLiferay.\n\n\nSuper Gluu multi-factor authentication\n#\n\n\nGluu offers a free two-factor authentication mobile application for iOS and Android called \nSuper Gluu\n. Super Gluu can be used to achieve multi-factor authentication to applications that send users to a Gluu Server for login. The Gluu Server includes support for Super Gluu out-of-the-box. \n\n\nLearn \nhow to enable\n Super Gluu in the Gluu Server.\n\n\nLearn \nhow to use\n the Super Gluu mobile application.\n\n\nIn addition to Super Gluu, the Gluu Server can be configured to support any third-party authentication mechanism that either supports the FIDO U2F authentication standard, or exposes a web API that can be called over the Internet. Learn more in the \nuser authentication introduction\n. \n\n\nSupport\n#\n\n\nWe are committed to free community support! You can browse or register and post \nquestions on our \nsupport site\n. All community\nquestions are public, and we do our best to answer them in a timely \nmanner. \n\n\nPrivate support, guaranteed response times, and consultative \nsupport are available to organizations who purchase a support contract.

For example, Asimba requires more restarts when certain\n   configuration is updated.\n\n\nLogs: \nwrapper.log\n was getting too busy. It's better to have\n   the top-level log smaller.

The Gluu Server will continue to support \nseveral LDAP servers, but will now ship with OpenLDAP.

Some basic information about the VM/server is displayed in the welcome screen. The version is displayed on top followed by free memory,disk space. The health of the VM/server can be easily determined from the welcome page. There is a photo icon on the right hand top side of the page which can be used to navigate to the user-profile and logging out of Gluu Server CE.\n\n\nThe menu on the left side of the welcome page is used to navigate the admin interface for Gluu Server. The menu has separate buttons for SAML, OpenID Connect and UMA. The user-management menu is found under \nUsers\n and the user-profile is under \nPersonal\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration tab contians the tools to configure Gluu Server CE. This section is dedicated to all tuning and tinkering except integration tools.\nThe configuration menu is divided in to other sections which are revealed on click. The administrator can manage authentication, registration, attributes, cache-refresh,logs etc. from this menu.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three sections in the organization configuration page which are \nSystem Configuration\n, \nSMTP Server Configuration\n and \nOxTrust Settings\n. These sections are detailed below with screenshots.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n\nGluu Server CE is shipped with a built-in \nWhite Pages\n feature which can be enabled from the system configuration page. This page also contains the options to enable \nSelf-Service Password Reset\n which allows the Gluu Server users to reset their password via email. This options depends on the \nSMTP Server Configuration\n, also available under the organization configuration page. Additionally the \nSCIM Support\n can be enabled from the System Configuration page. If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be updated from the System Configuration interface. \nMaximum Log Size (MB)*\n, by default Gluu UI will have 200 mb as the size of the log file and this value could be manipulated according to the administrator. Either this value could be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n\nThe mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.\n\n\n\nOxTrust Settings\n\nSome basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page. The administrator can change the organization name, logo and favicon settings from this page as well. Finally oxTrust Settings page contains the name of the administrator group for Gluu Server. The users added in this group will have administrator access in Gluu Server where they will be able to maintain/configure the server.\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe configuration files are accessible from the administrator interface (oxTrust). \nThere are three tabs under the \nJSON Configuration\n menu\n\n\n\n\nThe oxtrust JSON configuration file is accessible from this tab and it can be edited from this page. The changes are updated by clicking on the \nUpdate\n button on the bottom of the page. \n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. This page also contains the supported response, grants and algorithms among other information. The details will follow later on this documentation.\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for the file method of importing users into Gluu Server CE. The administrator can import users from a \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import data in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nThe \nManage Authentication\n page contains the internal OpenDJ settings for Gluu Server CE. \nThe \nDefault Authentication Method\n defines the authentication mechanism used for general \nauthentication and oxTrust authentication. The separation is introduced because the users \nlogging into Service Providers (SP) do not see the administrative console. \nThe \noxTrust authentication mode\n decides the authentication mechasims for the users \nlogging into the oxTrust admin interface.\n\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nIt will not be an understatement to say that the custom script feature makes \nGluu Server CE so robust and dynamic. The scripts are available for all intents \nand purposes the major being multi-factor authentication. There are many custom scritps \nincluded with the vanilla Gluu Server CE which can be enabled by clicking the check box. This section is \ndiscussed in detail under \nUser Authentication Guide\n \n\n\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE is shiped with the feature to register users via the user-registration endpoint. \nThe registry feature contains a Captcha which can be disabled from this page. Additionally it is \npossible to enable registration configuration from attributes.\n\n\nThis tabs has two options:\n1. \nDisable Captcha for registration form\n\n2. \nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n\n\nDisable Captcha for registration form\n\nThis option allows to you to decide whether you require captcha to be displayed\nin the registration form while the person is registering.\n\n\n\nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n\nThis section allows you to filter list of attributes to be displayed in the registration form.\nYou will be able to search for the attribute and move the selected attribute by clicking on the drop down\nlist and moving to the other column by clicking on \nAdd\n or \nAdd all\n if you have selected multiple attributes.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nThe attributes that are avalaible in the Gluu Server CE is found in this page. The administration can only see the active attributes when this page is accessed. The \nShow All Attributes\n button will show the inactive attributes too. Custom attributes can be added by clicking the \nAdd Attribute\n button and filling up a simple form. \n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the mechanism used by Gluu Server CE to import users from a \nbackend LDAP/AD data source. The entire configuration is handled from this page. \nThe \nCache Refresh\n will notify the administrator of any problem with cache refresh \nthe last time it was run. The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page \nwith the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n form. The key attributes, object class and the \nsource attributes can be defined from the \nCustomer  BackendKey/Attributes\n tab. The \nbackend server address, bind DN and other information must go to the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab.\n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer\n#\n\n\nThe logs for oxauth, oxtrust, cache refresh and the tomcat log can be configured \nfrom this tab. The log paths are given with the functionality to define any new \nlog template with log file path.\n\n\nView Log File\n#\n\n\nThe log files are listed in the \nView Log File\n page under the \nAllowed Log Files\n tab. \nThe individual logs can be tailed by clicking them. The \nConfiguration\n contains the \nlast line count which will show the number of lines specified from the log in the \nTail of Log File\n tab. \nThis section is an alternative to getting into the Gluu \nchroot\n and tailing the log files.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page will give some basic information about the Gluu Server such as the \nhostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the \nbackend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page will give the certificate information for Gluu Server. \nThe issuer info along with the algorithm used and the expiry date is also available.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE contains all SAML related functionalities under the \nSAML\n tab \ndivided into outbound and inbound SAML transactions. Inbound SAML is also known as ASIMBA. \n\n\nOutbound\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTrust Relationships\n page, as the name suggests, will allow the administrator to \nview the created trust relationships (TRs) by searching using the search button. \nThere is a button to add relationship with the same name. All the available TRs can be \nsearched by using two (2) spaces in the search bar. There are some information that the \nadministrator needs to gather before creating any new TR in Gluu Server. The metadata of the \nService Provider (SP) connected using TR must be gathered along with the required attributes. \nThe creation of TR will be covered in detail later.\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is another protocol supported by Gluu Server \nCE following the \nopenID Connect specifications\n. \nThe scopes page contains the \nAdd Scope\n button which can be used to add new scopes in Gluu Server. \nAdditionally the available scopes can be searched by name or listed using two (2) spaces in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect clients are accessible from the \nClients\n page under \nOpenID Connect\n tab. \nThe structure is similar to the scopes page with the functionality to search by name or use two (2) spaces \nto list all the available clients. New clients can be added by clicking the \nAdd Client\n button.\n\n\n\n\nUMA\n#\n\n\nUMA or (User-Managed Access) is an access management protocol supported by Gluu Server.\nThe available scopes can be searched using the search bar on the top of the page. \nNew scope descriptions can be added using the \nAdd Scope Description\n button.\n\n\n\nUMA resources page also has a searchbar on the top of the page and can be used \nto search for resource sets. New resource sets can be added by clocking on the \nAdd Resource Set\n button.\n\n\n\nUsers\n#\n\n\nUsers tab allows Gluu admin to do various task, including add admin, search users, Import users from file.\n\n\nPersonal\n#\n\n\nPersonal tab allows the individual person to view his basic profile and modify certain fields.",

This page also contains the options to enable  Self-Service Password Reset  which allows the Gluu Server users to reset their password via email. This options depends on the  SMTP Server Configuration , also available under the organization configuration page. Additionally the  SCIM Support  can be enabled from the System Configuration page. If the organization uses any custom  DNS Server(s) , the address should be updated from the System Configuration interface.  Maximum Log Size (MB)* , by default Gluu UI will have 200 mb as the size of the log file and this value could be manipulated according to the administrator. Either this value could be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.  SMTP Server Configuration \nThe mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.  OxTrust Settings \nSome basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page.

In this example we will consider adding facebook strategy.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add facebook strategy, search for passport-facebook npm module where you can select the npm module and then add the module to passport server.\n\n\nLet's say we found this module \"passport-facebook\" and want to use this module in for facebook authentication, install the module in passport app by executing \nnpm install passport-facebook --save\n to install the module and also save the dependency to the passport server.\n\n\nConfigure the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the strategy\n#\n\n\nAll the strategies are been configured in the folder server/auth/*.js.\nWe need to create new file named with the strategy name. Our strategy is facebook so we can create new file named facebook.js and configure the strategy.\n\n\nvar passport = require('passport');\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;\n\nvar setCredentials = function(credentials) {\n    var callbackURL = global.applicationHost.concat(\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\");\n    passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({\n            clientID: credentials.clientID,\n            clientSecret: credentials.clientSecret,\n            callbackURL: callbackURL,\n            enableProof: true,\n            profileFields: ['id', 'name', 'displayName', 'email']\n        },\n        function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {\n            var userProfile = {\n                id: profile._json.id,\n                name: profile.displayName,\n                username: profile.username || profile._json.id,\n                email: profile._json.email,\n                givenName: profile._json.first_name,\n                familyName: profile._json.last_name,\n                provider: profile.provider,\n                accessToken: accessToken\n            };\n            return done(null, userProfile);\n        }\n    ));\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    passport: passport,\n    setCredentials: setCredentials\n};\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the facebook strategy configured. For facebook \nthe required parameters are clientID, clientSecret and callbackURL. You \ncan search for more configurations depending on the requirements and \nconfigure accordingly.\n\n\nThe function setCredentials is used to configure the strategy of the \ncredentials of this strategy are been received. The parameter credentials \nholds the values that are stored in the oxTrust\n\n\nThe parameter callbackURL should point to the callback route that we \nwill configure in step 4. As we are configuring facebook strategy, the \n\ncallbackURL\n can be set to \n\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\"\n \naccording the the convention of the app. You can customise the \n\ncallbackURL\n but it is recommended not to change the convention.\n\n\nThe callback function has different number of parameters and data in \nthose parameters which are required to be mapped to the userProfile \nkeys which are \nid, name, username, email, givenName, familyName, provider, accessToken\n. \nHere id and provider params are must. Provider param holds the value of \nthe provider, i.e for facebook the provider value will be facebook etc. \nIn most cases the value of provider is received in the user claims itself.\n\n\nThen export the strategy that we configured and also the \nsetCredentials\n \nmethod which will be used to set the details of the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy\n#\n\n\nWe are going to set the routes for the strategy that we are going to configure.\nFirst require the strategy that we configured in the previous step.\n\n\nvar passportFacebook = require('../auth/facebook').passport;\n\n\n\n\nHere \nrequire('../auth/facebook').passport\n will include the passport \nstrategy that we have configured.\n\n\nThen add the routes for the strategy. First we are going to register the \ncallback route and then the authenticate route.\n\n\nThe authenticate route first validated the jwt token that is been sent by\nGluu Server to passport server. If the JWT is valid then the user is \nredirected to the strategy and user can be authenticated there and the \nresponse of the user authentication is redirected to callback route.\n\n\nIf the callback routes receives the user data then user is been \nredirected to Gluu.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nscope value can be set from the strategy itself it it supports that \nor you can set the scope value here too.\n\n\nThe callbackResponse method return the control to Gluu server and \nuser is been enrolled in the system.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n#\n\n\nIn this step we are going to call the setCredentials method of the \nstrategy that we have created.\n\n\nGo to the file configureStrategies.js in auth folder of passport \nserver and require the strategy that we have created.\n\n\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('./facebook');\n\n\n\n\nAnd then in setConfiguratins function, call the setCredentials \nmethod if the strategy data is received.\n\n\n//FacebookStrategy\nif (data.passportStrategies.facebook) {\n    logger.log('info', 'Facebook Strategy details received');\n    logger.sendMQMessage('info: Facebook Strategy details received');\n    FacebookStrategy.setCredentials(data.passportStrategies.facebook);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will configure the passport strategy if the details of the \nstrategy are received from passport API.\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n#\n\n\nSo far the passport server is ready with the new strategy that we have \ncreated, but to call the strategy we need to add a button which calls \nthe new strategy.\n\n\n<a data-p=\"facebook\" class=\"provider\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" style=\"height:40px; width:120px\">\n    <img alt=\"facebook\" src=\"img/facebook.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\"></img>\n</a>\n\n\n\n\nHere the data-p and class=\"provider\" are required to call the strategy. \nThe data-p attribute should hold the value of the route that we created \nin routes.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nIn order to call the Strategy, the request URL to call the API must \nmatch the route that we configured.",

Specifying a path will \nmake script development easier. There is also an option to revert back to \na working script if the script is faulty or needs further enhancements. \nThe administrator can select \nFile\n from the Script Location Type in \noxTrust and the file input box will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe 'LDAP' option in the Script Location Type can be used to store the \nscript in the LDAP tree once the development is complete. Remember that \nselecting the \nLDAP\n method requires the script to be copied in the input \nbox that appears upon LDAP selection:\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Development Environment\n#\n\n\nGluu Server custom scripts are written in \nJython\n. \nIt is recommended to use Eclipse for coding purposes.\n\n\nNow, create some files:\n- A Python file for your script\n- One or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication\n- One or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide \nsome information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.\n\n\nSamples and Documentation\n#\n\n\nThere are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into Gluu's\n\n\noxAuth integrations folder\n. \nAlso, the respective \nXHTML\n and \nXML\n files are checked in to the \nauth folder\n.\nThe interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the \nGluu Documentation\n.\n\n\nWe used the \nBasic Script\n \nas a template. The \nWikid forms\n \nwere also used as a template since it is required to pass the value of the \"code\" \nobtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication in order to validate and authenticate the user.\n\n\nThe \nWikid authentication\n script was also looked upon quite a bit for examples on how to process the form.\n\n\nImplement methods - Using Twilio SMS\n#\n\n\nSimple example of how to add a custom template and how to pass values between \n2 steps of authentication and save the value temporarily for authentication of a user. Our Sample \n\nTwilio script\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI\n\n\nNavigate to \"Configuration\" on the Menu panel to the left\n\n\nSelect Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click on \"Add custom script configuration\"\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, Programming Language (Python will be by default, \nmay be in future Java or JavaSCript will be added)\n\n\nSelect the Level needed to set the security level to.\n\n\nSelect Location Type from the script to be executed.\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type required for the authentication.\n\n\nDefine Custom property which is provided by Twilio and can be noted down from \nTwilio account page of the signed up user. \n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the added custom script.\n\n\nScroll down to the end of the update and click on Update button to submit the form. \n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, click on Manage Authenticaion on the Menu Panel to left. \n\n\nSelect \"Default Authentication Method\" tab and change the oxTrust authentication mode \nto \"Twilio\" or \"Name of the script\" from the drop down.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.\n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.\n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n\n\nThe most important method to implement is obviously the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.\n\n\nBelow are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", \n<key>\n). Where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n\n\nUserService.instance()\n \nGets the user login instance\n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n\n\nTo access  information from requestParameters in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .\n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n\n\ngetAttribute():\n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n\nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get(\n<key>\n). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n\n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample \n\nDuo script\n,\n\n\nDuo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n\n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.\n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n\n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.\n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get(\n<key>\n), where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n\n\nSaving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.\n\n\nRetriving and passing values between the authentication steps:\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.\n\n\nCustom Properties\n#\n\n\nSometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot. If administrators are\nnot allowed to modify the script, Custom Property feature can be used, as illustrated in below screenshot:\n\n\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"\n\").getValue2\"():\n\n\nTo access this information in your script with \n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2()\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve.\n\n\nReturning a message to the user\n#\n\n\nIt is possible to use the Context to return a message to the\nuser, which could be especially useful if an error occurs, or if\nrequired to have some kind of user action.\n\n\nAdding Libraries\n#\n\n\nPure Python libraries, can be added to \n/opt/gluu/python/libs\n, jar files can be added to  \n/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/lib/ext\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\njar files should be added within chroot. \n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nWhen the scripting is done, you can test the script by print\nthe statments to oxtrust.log under \n/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs/oxtrust.log\n. \n\n\nAnd by prefix the logs, will help to find the script at ease\nusing tail command \ntail -f | grep <prefix>\n, the prefix logs will\nprovide the script output while one trys to login using the script.\n\n\nIn the Twilio test script, a specific method called\n\nprintOut\n has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.\n\n\nAlso, remember that putting all the code in a \ntry / catch\n\nis a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions. Since during\ndebugging, those exception may provide a hint pointing what causes the issue.\n\n\nFurther logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using oxauth_script.log and oxauth.log\nunder\n/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/logs/\n which is within the chroot.\n\n\nReverting Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not unlikely that one may get locked out of Gluu\nServer, while testing the authentication script.\n\n\nIf there is any problem in it.

There the step is sent into the  authenticate  method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.  Below are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.  random.randit()  \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)  context.set() \nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid.

            "text": "SAML\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) redirects a user to a designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. The IDP will ask for the user's credentials and upon successful authentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. \n\n\nIn order for this transaction to happen successfully there must be pre-established trust between the IDP and the SP. In the Gluu Server, the IDPs SSO configuration is called a Trust Relationship (TR). The following sections cover how to create a TR in the Gluu Server. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor any SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created in the IDP.\n\n\n\n\nTrust Relationship Requirements\n#\n\n\nEach Trust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.\n\n\nMetadata of the SP\n     \n\nMetadata is an XML file which has configuration data used to establish trust between the website (SP) and IDP (Gluu Server). Websites (SP) can provide metadata via a URL or as a separate file. Metadata can change, so a static URL typically requires the least amount of ongoing maintenance. \n\n\nRequired Attributes\n    \n\nEach SP may require one or many attributes in order to grant a user access. Required attributes vary depending on the application, and should be explicitly listed in the application's documentation. The Gluu Server ships with certain preconfigured attributes and also supports the creation of custom attributes. Once the attributes are available in the Gluu Server, the administrator only needs to click on the desired attribute(s) and it will be released to the SP upon successful user authentication.\n\n\nSSO Testing Endpoint\n     \n\nEvery website (SP) should have both a staging and a production URI\nendpoint which can be checked for SSO. It's important to thoroughly test all scenarios in a development environment before moving the configuration into production. \n\n\nCreate a Trust Relationship in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to SAML \u2192 Trust Relationships\n\n\nClick on \u201cAdd Relationship\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new page will appear where you can provide all the required information to create a Trust\n  Relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)     \n\n\nDescription\n: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.    \n\n\n\n\nMetadata Type\n: There are four available options to choose from. The correct Type depends on how the SP is delivering Metadata to your IDP.      \n\n\n\n\nFile\n: Choose File if the SP has provided an uploadable metadata document in XML format.\n\n\nURI\n: Chose URI if the SP metadata is hosted on a URI that is accessible from the Internet.\n\n\nGenerate\n: Choose Generate if the SP is an \"inhouse application\" or the \u201cShibboleth SP\u201d is going to be installed in the target application (SP). This option will generate a how-to guide for installing the Shibboleth SP. If you plan on using the Generate method, please note the following:        \n\n        * \nURL\n : This is the hostname of the SP.   \n\n        * \nPublic certificate\n : You must provide the certificate, which is a Base64 encoded ASCII file, and contain \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\". This certificate \ncan not\n be password protected.             \n\n        * After creating the Trust Relationship, download the generated configuration files from the \nDownload Shibboleth2 configuration files\n link and place these configuration files inside your SP configuration.         \n\n\nFederation\n: Choose this option if the target application (SP) is affiliated with a federation service (e.g. InCommon, NJEdge etc.). Once you select \u201cFederation\u201d as the Metadata Type, another drop down menu called \u201cSelect Federation\u201d will appear. From this drop menu you can select the appropriate federation. After selecting the \u201cFederation Name\u201d, a new link called \u201cClick to select\nentity id\u201d will appear. Use this link to find and select the SP entityIDs that you wish to create SSO with. Learn how to establish trust with a federation \nbelow\n.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased\n: The SPs required attributes must be added to this panel. The required attributes can be selected from the menu on the left with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TR is added by clicking the \nAdd\n button located in the lower left side of the page.     \n\n\nRelying Party Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support SAML, the Relying Party software must be configured. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox \nConfigure specific Relying Party\n must be checked.     \n\n\n     \n\n\nThe checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to find information about configuring the relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.     \n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support a federation standard like SAML, and you or the developer are planning on adding federation to the application, we strongly recommend using OpenID Connect rather than SAML. OpenID Connect is newer, easier to use, and follows modern best practices. Learn more in our blog: \nOAuth vs. SAML vs. OpenID Connect\n.\n\n\n\n\nFederation Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the SP is part of an identity federation such as InCommon, the administrator must add the federation as an SP in the Gluu Server. This will enable the administrator to more easily create TRs with SPs in the federation. The example below shows how an administrator would add a TR for the InCommon Federation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce a TR has been established with the federation, the Gluu Server administrator can easily create TRs with any SP included in the federation by selecting the federation from the \nFederation Name\n drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.\n\n\n\n\nInbound SAML\n#\n\n\nInbound SAML allows users from external identity providers to SSO into services protected by the Gluu Server. The Gluu Server uses an open source product called \nAsimba\n to achieve inbound SAML. Asimba allows SPs to use a single IDP for SSO even when users come from multiple trusted external IDPs. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is shipped with a SAML Script which simplifies the process of using Asimba. This section provides a step-by-step method of configuring Asimba with two (2) IDPs and a single SP. The administrator can add multiple IDPs or SPs if required using the same method. However, it is required that all SPs and IDPs are connected to the Asimba server, or the IDP that has the Asimba module enabled.\ni\n\n\nRequired Setup\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup hostname\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://sp.gluu.org/protected/print.py\n\n\nThis is a shibboleth SP connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a Gluu Server SAML IDP with Asimba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://nest.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a second Gluu Server SAML IDP connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Description of SAML Authentication Module is available here: \nhttps://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/tree/master/Server/integrations/saml\n\n\nSpecific Setup Details\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server setup with the hostname \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n must be setup with Asimba.

            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0. \nOpenID Connect is a specific implementation of OAuth 2.0 \nwhere the identity provider holds protected resources that a \nthird-party application needs to access on behalf of a person. \nOpenID Connect allows relying parties to verify the identity of, and obtain information about a person requesting to access the applications protected resources. \n\n\nJargon\n#\n\n\nIn OpenID Connect the key entities include:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nend user\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 resource owner) whose user information the application needs to access.\n\n\n\n\nThe end user wants to login to an application using an existing account at an OpenID Connect identity provider (OP).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelying Party (RP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 client) needs access to the end user's protected user information.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, an online chat application needs to know who is accessing the application in order to present the correct user account and contacts. \n\n\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Provider (OP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 authorization server and also resource server) that holds the user information and grants access.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is an OpenID Provider. The OP holds information about the user and allows the end user or the organization (depending on configuration) to consent to providing the RP with access to user information. OpenID Connect defines a unique identification for an account (subject identifier + issuer identifier), and the RP can use this as a key to its own user profile. \n\n\nThe relying party can verify claims about the identity of the end user, and log the user out at the end of a session. OpenID Connect also makes it possible to discover the OpenID Provider for an end user, and to register relying party client applications dynamically. OpenID connect services are built on OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Token (JWT), WebFinger and Well-Known URIs.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Support in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a \nfully certified OpenID Connect Provider (OP)\n. As an OpenID Provider, the Gluu Server enables OpenID Connect relying parties (clients) to discover its capabilities, handle both dynamic and static registration of relying parties, respond to relying party requests with authorization codes, access tokens, and user information according to the Authorization Code and Implicit flows of OpenID Connect, and manages sessions.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Implicit Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Implicit Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant. The main difference between the OAuth and OpenID Connect implicit flows lie in the use of the id_token, which must be returned in Connect. The id_token adds additional security to the transaction. For more information, read the \nOpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's guide\n.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant. The authorization code flow is more secure than the implicit flow because the tokens are never exposed to the web browser and possibly other malicious applications with access to the browser. As with the implicit flow the extra securuty in Connect's authorization code flow stems from the id_token. \n\n\nOpenID Connect Hybrid Flow\n#\n\n\nHybrid flow is a combination of the Implicit Flow and Authorization Code \nFlow. It allows an application to request a combination of identity token, \naccess token, and code via the front channel using either a fragment \nencoded redirect (native and JS based clients) or a form post \n(server-based web applications). This enables scenarios where your client\n app can make immediate use of an identity token to get access to the \n user\u2019s identity, but also retrieve an authorization code that can be \n used by a back end service to request a refresh token, thus gaining long \n lived access to resources.\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nThe first thing you want to know about any OAuth 2.0 API is where the\nendpoints are (i.e. what are the URIs where you call the APIs).\nOpenID Connect provides a very simple mechanism to accomplish this: \n\nOpenID Connect Discovery\n.\n\n\nIn order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect\nservices for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is.\nOpenID Connect uses \nWebFinger\n\nto locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.\n\n\nOnce the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information\nfor the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document,\nincluding its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.\n\n\nSample Discovery Request\n#\n\n\nIf you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following\nWebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type:

   }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Issuer location discovered, the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be retrieved.\n\n\nThe RP makes the following request to the Issuer \nhttps://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n to obtain its\nConfiguration information:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type:

client.execOpenIdConfiguration();\n\n\n\n\nSee \norg.xdi.oxauth.ws.rs.ConfigurationRestWebServiceHttpTest\n\n\nAlgorithm\n#\n\n\noxAuth supports various types of signature and encryption\nalgorithms for authorizing request parameter passing, ID token signature\nand encryption, signing return responses, Encrypt User Info Endpoints\netc.\n\n\nNote:\n It is a good practice to implement ID Token Signatures with the RSA\nSHA-256 algorithm (algorithm value RS256). Additionally, oxAuth also\nsupports other algorithms that are listed below.\n\n\nAvailable Signature Algorithms:\n none, HS256, HS384, HS512, RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512.\n\n\nEncryption, Key Encryption Algorithms:\n RSA1_5, RSA-OAEP, A128KW, A256KW.\n\n\nBlock Encryption Algorithms:\n A128CBC+HS256, A256CBC+HS612, A128GCM, A256GCM,\n\n\nSession management\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect lets the relying party track whether the end user is logged in at the provider, and also initiate end user logout at the provider. The specification has the relying party monitor session state using an invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage API.\n\n\nHowever, be forewarned that there is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all requirements for all domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession\nManagement\n is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return \nIMG\n HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side\nlogout, the domain admin can use \nCustom Logout scripts\n. This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.\n\n\nThe key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Relying Party Registration\n#\n\n\nRelying parties can register with the Gluu Server both statically, by the Gluu Server admin, and dynamically, as specified by OpenID Connect Discovery. To allow dynamic registration, you register an initial OAuth 2.0 client that other relying parties can use to get access tokens for registration. You can also enable OpenID Connect relying parties to register dynamically without having to provide an access token. If dynamic registration is enabled, make sure to limit or throttle registrations as it could be used as a form of DDOS.\n\n\nClient Code\n#\n\n\nAlthough you can use generic OAuth 2.0 client libraries to call OpenID Connect endpoints, you would have to implement code to take advantage of some of OpenID Connect's features. For example, there is no id_token in OAuth 2.0, so you won't find any code for id_token validation in an OAuth 2.0 library. A good OpenID Connect client will do much of the heavy lifting for you. \n\n\nJavaScript Client\n#\n\n\nA JavaScript client is one of the easiest ways to use OpenID Connect, although it's not the most secure. The client we recommend was forked from a sample application written to demonstrate how easy it is to use Connect. Gluu forked the code, and has enhanced it since the time of its original publishing. The project can be found on \nGithub\n.\n\n\nIt's not a fancy app--it sends the person to the authorization endpoint to be authenticated, and then prints the claims tha are returned in the id_token. Currently the client does not handle dynamic client registration. \n\n\nYou'll have to add the client manually to the Gluu Server via the GUI. When completing the \nadd client\n form, you can use the following configuration:\n\n\nClient Name: Implicit Test Client\nresponse_type: token id_token\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nSubject Type: public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: token id_token\nGrant Types: implicit\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have registered the client in the Gluu Server, all you need to do is update the \nclient_id\n, \nredirect_uri\n, and \nproviderInfo\n values in the login page html. Assuming you've checked out the project into a web accessible folder, then navigate to the page and test! \n\n\nServer-Side libraries\n#\n\n\nMany applications are \"server-side\", meaning the web page displays content but most of the dynamic business logic resides on the web server. The OpenID Foundation maintains a list of client libraries on \ntheir website\n. However, our experience has been that the quality of these libraries varies widely. Some are not well documented, other are not updated frequently, and some do not implement essential security features available in OpenID Connect. In addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes difficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called \noxd\n.  \n\n\noxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per day per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on \nGitHub\n, and there are free open source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, Ruby, Perl and Go. There are also plugins available for several popular open source applications.\n\n\nWatch the oxd demo\n.\n\n\nGet an oxd license for free\n\n\nApache HTTPD module\n#\n\n\nA popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server filter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that connection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager. \n\n\nOne of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code. \n\n\nOne of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called \nmod_auth_openidc\n. It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source. \n\n\nNote: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar \nLua implementation\n to make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS. \n\n\nAppAuth for Mobile Applications\n#\n\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Connect is to authenticate people from a mobile application. The IETF draft \n\"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"\n provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).\n\n\nIn 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for \nAndroid\n and \niOS\n. The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier). \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is the only free open source OpenID Connect Provider that currently supports AppAuth. \n\n\noxAuth RP\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server ships with an optional OpenID Connect relying \nparty web application, which is handy for testing.\n\nIt's called oxauth-rp. During Gluu Server setup, you'll be asked if you \nwant to install it--which you should on a development environment. \nIt will be deployed on \nhttps://<hostname>/oxauth-rp\n. Using this tool \nyou can exercise all of the OpenID Connect API's, including discovery, \nclient registration, authorization, token, userinfo, and end_session.",

The specification has the relying party monitor session state using an invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage API.  However, be forewarned that there is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all requirements for all domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.  The OpenID Connect  Session\nManagement  is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return  IMG  HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).  The Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side\nlogout, the domain admin can use  Custom Logout scripts . This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.  The key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.",

In addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes difficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called  oxd .    oxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per day per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on  GitHub , and there are free open source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, Ruby, Perl and Go.

            "text": "A popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server filter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that connection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager.   One of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code.   One of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called  mod_auth_openidc . It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source.

The IETF draft  \"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"  provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).  In 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for  Android  and  iOS . The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier).

The setup script prepares the \nconfiguration necessary for SCIM UMA RS endpoints and SCIM UMA RP client \nand \nthis template\n \nis used. \n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The JWKS for RS and RP clients are put into the \n./output/scim.ldif\n file ready for SCIM configuration.\nThe \nsetup.properties.file\n contains the RS and RP JWKS in Base64 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following command to extract OpenID SCIM RS and RP Client ID\n\ncat setup.properties.last | grep \"scim_rs_client_id\\|scim_rp_client_id\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UMA SCIM client requires JWKS, so the setup script extracts the JWKS from \nsetup.properties.last\n and puts it into the \n./output/scim-rp.jks\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n For versions before v2.4.4, the JWKS is put in the \n./output/scim-rp-openid-keys.json\n file instead.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nEnable SCIM from Organization Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust SCIM UMA configuration is automatically updated while running the \nsetup.py\n and the correct values are setup \nin the \noxtrust-config.json\n file.\n\n\n\n\n  \"umaIssuer\":\"https://%(hostname)s\",\n  \"umaClientId\":\"%(scim_rs_client_id)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyId\":\"\",\n  \"umaResourceId\":\"1447184268430\",\n  \"umaScope\":\"https://%(hostname)s/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/uma/scopes/scim_access\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStoreFile\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_fn)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStorePassword\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_pass_encoded)s\",\n\n\n\n\n\n\numaClientKeyId\n can be updated with the \nalias\n from \nscim-rp.jks\n file; if it is not updated, the first key from the file is used automatically.\n\n\n\n\nTesting SCIM UMA\n#\n\n\nThe following is a sample code that can be run to test the configured SCIM UMA Gluu CE. It uses \nSCIM-Client\n, a Java library also developed by Gluu intended for client applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Maven, below is how to add SCIM-Client to your project:\n\n\n\n\n<repositories>\n  <repository>\n    <id>gluu</id>\n    <name>Gluu repository</name>\n    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>\n  </repository>\n</repositories>\n...\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>\n  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>\n  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with Release v2.4.2, an SCIM-Client must be used on a matching Gluu CE. For example, if you are running CE v2.4.4, you must also use SCIM-Client v2.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your domain's SSL certificate to the JRE's \ncacerts\n certificate key store where your client application will run. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply the UMA parameters and run the code. \nNOTE:\n If you have re-installed Gluu CE, please note that the UMA parameters / JWKS files are also regenerated. You must then rebuild your client code with \ntarget\n or \ntmp\n folders possibly cleared beforehand to avoid conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage gluu.scim.client.dev.local;\n\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimClient;\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimResponse;\nimport gluu.scim2.client.Scim2Client;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\nimport javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;\n\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonGenerationException;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingException;\n\npublic class TestScimClient {\n\n    private static void testScim1Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final ScimClient scimClient = ScimClient.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        ScimResponse response = scimClient.personSearch(\"uid\", \"admin\", MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM1 \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    private static void testScim2Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final Scim2Client scim2Client = Scim2Client.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        String filter = \"userName eq \\\"admin\\\"\";\n        ScimResponse response = scim2Client.searchUsers(filter, 1, 1, \"\", \"\", null);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM2: \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, JAXBException {\n\n        final String domain = \"https://c67.gluu.info/identity/seam/resource/restv1\";\n        final String umaMetaDataUrl = \"https://c67.gluu.info/.well-known/uma-configuration\";\n        final String umaAatClientId = \"@!A410.188A.95DD.EA5A!0001!3A1E.BAA5!0008!5870.A795\";\n\n        final String umaAatClientJksPath = \"D:\\\\Development\\\\test_data\\\\scim\\\\scim-rp.jks\";\n        final String umaAatClientJksPassword = \"secret\";\n        final String umaAatClientKeyId = \"\";\n\n        testScim1Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n        testScim2Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 Test Mode (v2.4.4+)\n#\n\n\nStarting with CE v2.4.4, the \"test mode\" configuration will help developers test the SCIM 2.0 endpoints easier. Instead of UMA + SCIM-Client, in test mode a long-lived OAuth2 access token issued by the Gluu server is used to authorize with the SCIM 2.0 endpoints.\n\n\nTo enable test mode, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nLogin to the oxTrust GUI and go to \"Configuration\" -> \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\", then locate the property \nscimTestMode\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet it to \ntrue\n, then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. The Gluu server will then create a long-lived OAuth2 access token with a validity period of one year. Doing this will also switch the authentication scheme from UMA to OAuth2 Access Token.\n\n\nClick again \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\" in the left navigation pane. This will retrieve the access token and be displayed in the \nscimTestModeAccessToken\n property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the access token has expired, just repeat the previous steps to create a new one.\n\n\n\n\nThe access token can then be used as the query string parameter \naccess_token\n in accessing the SCIM 2.0 endpoints, for example:\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify the current authentication scheme of the SCIM 2.0 endpoints by browsing its \nServiceProviderConfig\n:\n\n\n\n\nTo exit test mode, just set \nscimTestMode\n back to \nfalse\n then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. This will switch the authentication scheme from OAuth2 Access Token to UMA. If you try using your access token again, you will now get the \n403 Unauthorized\n error:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\nUMA is protected with SCIM in Gluu Server Community Edition (CE). The usage of UMA requires HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests. Before testing, the Client making the requests must be added/registered in Gluu CE. The UMA configuration is available @ \nhttps://hostname/.well-known/uma-configuration\n. The request to authorization endpoint must accompanied with  application/json content type. \n\n\nThe example below shows the parameters used in a real-life use case  where the UMA RPT Token is authorized in oxAuth.\n\n\n    public RptAuthorizationResponse requestRptPermissionAuthorization(@HeaderParam(\"Authorization\") String authorization,\n            @HeaderParam(\"Host\") String amHost, RptAuthorizationRequest rptAuthorizationRequest);\n\n\n\n\nIf the default openID SCIM Client is not used, the \ninum\n must be added to the UMA Authorization Policy Custom Script.",

In order to do that you need to modify the \nlogin.xhtm    l\n file, which is located in \n/opt/tomcat/webapps/oxauth/\n.

Point your browser at \nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\nYou should see a list of current environment variables. \n\n\nConfiguration of mod_auth_openidc\n#\n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nmod_auth_openidc\n module depends on the Ubuntu package \nlibjansson4\n: \n\n\n# apt-get install libjansson\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need the mod_auth_openidc and libjose packages which can \nbe downloaded from the \nReleases Page\n.\n\n\nFor example, at this time the current release is 2.1.3, so the command would be:\n\n\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGet the latest packages here: https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases\n\n\n\n\nNote, if you like to build from source, you can clone the project at \nGithub Page\n\n\nNow you can enable the module\n\n\n# sudo a2enmod auth_openidc\n# sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods for client registration:\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Client Registration\n\n\nManual Client Registration\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, let's create the client manually in the Gluu Server.\nWhen you add the client, use the following parameters:\n\n\nName: mod_auth_openidc\nClient Secret: something-sufficiently-unguessable\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nlogin uri: https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nSubject Type: Public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: code\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a note of the \nclient_secret\n (you won't get to see it again)! You'll\nalso need the \nclient_id\n for the next step.\n\n\nInstall CGI script\n#\n\n\nThis cgi-script makes for a good test page! \n\n\n# vi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nThen paste in this code\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport os\n\nd = os.environ\nk = d.keys()\nk.sort()\n\nprint \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\"\n\nprint \"<HTML><Head><TITLE>Print Env Variables</TITLE></Head><BODY>\"\nprint \"<h1>Environment Variables</H1>\"\nfor item in k:\n    print \"<p><B>%s</B>: %s </p>\" % (item, d[item])\nprint \"</BODY></HTML>\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you'll need to make the script executable by the Apache2\n\n\n# chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n# chmod ug+x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Apache VirtualHost\n#\n\n\nYou are almost done! You'll need to configure mod_auth_openidc to\nprotect your server.\n\n\n# vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following right under \n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n\n\nOIDCProviderMetadataURL https://idp.mydomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\nOIDCClientID (client-id-you-got-back-when-you-added-the-client)\nOIDCClientSecret (your-client-secret)\nOIDCRedirectURI https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nOIDCResponseType code\nOIDCScope \"openid profile email\"\nOIDCSSLValidateServer Off\nOIDCCryptoPassphrase (a-random-seed-value)\nOIDCPassClaimsAs environment\nOIDCClaimPrefix USERINFO_\nOIDCPassIDTokenAs payload\n<Location \"/\">\n    Require valid-user\n    AuthType openid-connect\n</Location>\n\n\n\n\n\nThen restart Apache to effect the changes\n\n\n# service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most confusing part here is the \nOIDCRedirectURI\n--don't set this\nto a path used by your server. The apache-filter uses the redirect_uri \nto process the response from the OpenID Provider (Gluu Server). \n\n\nNow you're ready to test. Open your web browser, and point it at \n\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n \n\n\nIf you're not logged in already, you should be redirected to \nthe authentication page. If you are logged in, you should just see\nan html page with the \nREMOTE_USER\n variable populated. Also\ncheck out the \nOIDC_id_token_payload\n and all the claims for \n\nUSERINFO_\n \n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nWe assume that all the hostnames will be dns resolvable. If not, then\nadd the according entries in \n/etc/hosts\n, please.\n\n\nAdd EPEL Repository\n#\n\n\nRun the following command to \nAdd EPEL Repo\n.\n\n\n\n\n# rpm -ivh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm\n\n\n\n\nApache Web Server\n#\n\n\nTo setup \nApache2 SSL\n, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the hiredis package is not found by the \nyum\n command, please download it manually from \nthis page\n and install it.\n\n\n\n\n# yum install httpd mod_ssl\n# yum install curl hiredis jansson\n\n\n\n\nConfigure SSL Module\n#\n\n\nThis section will guide you to create SSL certificates.\nUse the following commands to crete a  directory and generate the certificates.\n\n\n# mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl\n# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem -keyout /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter some values such as company name, country etc. Please enter them and your certificate will be ready. A template is given below\n\n\n    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US\n    State or Province Name (full name) []:TX\n    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Austin\n    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Gluu\n    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n    Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:modauth-centos.info\n    Email Address []:support@gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to configure Apache to use the certificates and use the following command to edit the \nssl.conf\n file. \n\n\n# vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\nThe important part of the configuration is to enter the path to the created SSL certificates. The example is given below.\n\n\nNote:\n Please make sure to use the correct server name in the configuration file.\n\n\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n    ServerAdmin support@gluu.org\n    ServerName gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nRestart Apache Server and you are done configuring the SSL Module.

Open your web browser, and point it at\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi`\n\n\noxRay\n#\n\n\nLifeRay\n OpenID Connect plugin to authenticate users using\nGluu IdP.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nThe oxAuth LifeRay plugin is used to authenticate and auto-log users\nfrom Gluu Server into \nLifeRay\n with the same credentials. It\nis built on top of oxAuth, the OpenID Connect provider by Gluu.\n\n\nThe oxAuth plugin intercepts any attempt to login from anywhere in the\nLifeRay and redirects the request and the user to an oxAuth server where\nthe identification takes place, actually. If the user has authorized the\nserver to share some of his basic information with the oxAuth plugin,\nthe user will be redirected back to the LifeRay CMS, and logged in,\nautomatically.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to use the LifeRay CMS as the basis for an\norganizational personal data store service.\n\n\nNote: This plugin does not support auto-user creation from information\nsupplied by the oxAuth Plugin. Instead, it can be implemented by\nextending the plugin.\n\n\nDeployment\n#\n\n\nThe plugin is provided in two variants--\nMaven\n and \nAnt\n.\nYou can either use Maven or the LifeRay plugin SDK to build and deploy\nthis plugin as a standard LifeRay hot deployable WAR file.\n\n\nDeploying WAR file using Maven\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: make sure that you have \nMaven\n\ninstalled on your system to build this plugin from source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the Maven source from the [oxRay Repository][https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxRay/tree/master/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the file \npom.xml\n in \ngluu-openid-connect-hook\n, and update\nyour local LifeRay Tomcat bundle path. This is required for building the\nWAR file and deploying to the LifeRay Tomcat bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the \ngluu/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n \ndirectory:\n\n\n\n\nmvn clean install package liferay:deploy\n\n\n\n\nThis will take a few seconds to download the dependency \njar\n files, and\ngenerate the LifeRay-compiled deployable WAR file. It will be placed\nwithin your \n<liferay-bundle-folder>/deploy\n directory, and the hot\ndeployable process will start.\n\n\nUsing LifeRay Plugin SDK With Ant\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: we assume that you have the plugin SDK\nboth installed and configured with LifeRay bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the gluu-openid-connect-hook plugin source from the\nrepository, and place these files in your local directory for the plugin\nSDK. Usually, this is \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the folder \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nant clean deploy\n\n\n\n\nUsing Binary From Repository\n#\n\n\nYou can also download a compiled binary as a standard LifeRay deployable\nWAR file from the following location:\n\n\noxRay LifeRay Deployable War File\n\n\nCopy this WAR file in your LifeRay bundle. Usually, this is located at\n\nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1/deploy\n.\n\n\nOnce the plugin is deployed as a WAR file either using Maven or Ant, you\nwill see the following success message in your LifeRay Tomcat server:\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nA LifeRay application needs to be registered with the Authorization\nserver before initiating an authentication request/response with OAuth\nIdP server.\n\n\nThe following steps are necessary to obtain both a client id and a\nclient secret. These data will be used within the LifeRay portal\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the location \nhttps://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp/home.seam\n.\n\n\nYou will see the Dynamic Client Registration Section.\n\n\nEnter the Registration Endpoint uri, for example\n\nhttps://idp.example.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize\n.\n\n\nYou can derive this uri from your IdP auto-discovery uri which is\nlike that: \nhttps://<Your IDP Server Domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nYou can search for the registration endpoint, and copy that uri here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the redirect uris as \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n:\n\n\nReplace your domain name with \nlocalhost:8080\n\n\nThis will be your LifeRay handler for logging a user into LifeRay,\nautomatically, when a redirect comes back from the OAuth server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Response Types: CODE\n\n\nSelect the Application Type: WEB\n\n\nFor development purposes use: NATIVE (if you are testing on a local\nmachine with \nlocalhost:8080\n domain)\n\n\nEnter Client Name: LifeRay App (you can choose any name here).\n\n\nAll other options can be left as they are--please see the attached\nscreenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n, and both the following \nRegistration Request\n and\n\nRegistration Response\n will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Registration Response to your local system. The parameters\n\nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n are used in LifeRay when configuring\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\n\n\nModifying portal.properties\n#\n\n\nIt is necessary to modify \nportal-ext.properties\n file to reflect oxAuth\nserver client credentials and server's URL. It can be accomplished by\nnavigating into the \nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1\n folder, where the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n is stored.\n\n\nNote: To either activate or deactivate the oxAuth plugin put the value\n\ntrue\n (to activate) or \nfalse\n (to deactivate), respectively.\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.auth.enabled=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxAuth client ID and client secret:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.id=@!1111!0008!51CE.1E59\ngluu.openidconnect.client.secret=65777eb7-87a8-4d60-9dbc-d31d43971f2b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server domain\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.domain=https://idp.gluu.org`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server auto discovery uri\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.url.discovery=https://idp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour OAuth server logout uri (typically, this will be used to logout a\nuser from OAuth when a user logs out from LifeRay)\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.logout=https://idp.gluu.org/identity/logout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeRay server callback uri that will be used as a handling response\nby the OAuth server after authentication:\n\n\nreplace the \nlocalhost:8080\n with your LifeRay domain name:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n\n\n\n\n This page will be invoked when the user does not exist in the\n LifeRay database, but gets authenticated from the OAuth Server.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, create a LifeRay page with the name \n/no-such-user-found\n,\n  or redirect to the LifeRay registration page uri like that:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.no.such.user.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/no-such-user-found\n\n\n\n\nRestart the LifeRay server after editing the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\nLogin Using the LifeRay Front End\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer Bootup\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay server is restarted, open your browser and\n  navigate to the uri \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin uri\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay page successfully loaded navigate to the OpenID\n  connect page at \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: you can edit the theme code, and link to the login uri as\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n. In result the user will\nalways redirect to the OAuth server for authentication.\n\n\n\n\nOAuth authentication\n\n\nThe LifeRay login uri will redirect users to the OAuth IdP server\n  for user authentication. Internally, passing the oAuth client id \n  as the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest for permission\n\n\nThis screen can be configured depending upon your OAuth Server\n  implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth callback (user auto-login to LifeRay)\n\n\nAfter a successful authentication with the OAuth server, IdP will\nsend a callback to LifeRay with a specific code as a parameter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback?code=xxx`\n\n\n\n\nThis will be intercepted by our oxAuth LifeRay plugin. Upon validation\nof the token with the Gluu IdP, it will result in a login of the user to\nthe LifeRay. The user will be redirected to his respective start page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect to authenticate a person in Java\n#\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Connect\n Protocol offers Java\ndevelopers a way to authenticate a person at any Internet domain that\nsupports the standard. To accomplish this, the domain must provide a way\nto register clients--the website and mobile applications that use the\nauthentication API offered by the domain.\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nDiscovery is the first step! Luckily, its super-easy! All you have to \ndo is make a get request to\n\nhttps://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nThis will return a JSON object, as described in the\n\nspecification\n.\nFor example, you can see Gluu's OpenID Connect discovery\n\nurl\n.\n\n\nThis will tell you everything you need to know about this OpenID Connect\nprovider, like what are the endpoints (URLs), what crypto is supported,\nand what user claims can you ask for.\n\n\nAn \nexample\n\nof a Discovery Request, using the oxAuth RP library.\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nIn SAML, the website was called a \"Service Provider.\" In OpenID Connect,\nthe website (or mobile application) is called a \"Client\". Clients can be\nregistered manually by the OP, but more frequently, clients use the\n\nDynamic Registration\nAPI\n to\nautomate the process.\n\n\nObtaining the id_token\n#\n\n\nAfter your client is registered, it is time to get down to business.\nOpenID Connect offers two common workflows for authentication: basic\n(where the person is using a browser, and can be re-directed) and\nimplicit where the client sends the credentials, including the secret.\nThere is a useful implements guide for\n\nbasic\n and\n\nimplicit\n.\n\n\nLogout\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect defines a mechanism for \nSession\nManagement\n.\nThe idea is that JavaScript in a web tab can detect that another tab has\nlogged out. One detection of a logout event, the Web application can\ncleanup sessions in any backend systems as necessary. It is not 100%\neffective. If the tab is closed when the logout occurs in another tab,\nthe event may not be detected, and the backend systems are advised to\ntimeout sessions.\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect from JavaScript\n#\n\n\nSee \nOpenID Connect plugin for Passport\n for further details.",

Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontacts\n\n\ne-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_name\n\n\nName of the Client to be presented to the End-User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogo_uri\n\n\nURL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_uri\n\n\nURL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolicy_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntos_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks_uri\n\n\nURL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code\n\n        \nReason\n\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400\n\n            \ninvalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

One of these registered Redirection URI values must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request    response_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 response_type values that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token    grant_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are: authorization_code  The Authorization Code Grant Type implicit  The Implicit Grant Type refresh_token  The Refresh Token Grant Type The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list: code: authorization_code id_token: implicit token id_token: implicit code id_token: authorization_code, implicit code token: authorization_code, implicit code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit    application_type  Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.    contacts  e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.    client_name  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.    logo_uri  URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.    client_uri  URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.",

SCIM uses a REST API for operations which are disabled by default. The support for SCIM must be enabled from the oxTrust admin interface. \nSCIM is enabled from the Organization Configuration in the oxTrust administration interface. Please navigate to \nOrganization Configuration\n --> \nSystem Configuration\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlease navigate down the page to find \nSCIM Support\n in the \nSYstem Configuration\n page and select \nEnabled\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Endpoints\n#\n\n\nSCIM uses REST API for the operations which are covered in short in this section. There are two versions of the SCIM API each with its own specification. This usage of SCIM requires advanced level knowledge of HTTP GET and POST commands and not recommended for entry level users.\n\n\nThe SCIM 1.1 is governed by the \nSCIM:Protocol 1.1\n document and SCIM 2.0 is governed by the \nSCIM:Core Schema\n & \nSCIM:Protocol\n. As it is mentioned before, the specifications define an API, the operations are performed through endpoints. There are three endpoints that are available in Gluu Server SCIM:\n\n\n\n\nUser Endpoint\n\n\nGroup Endpoint\n\n\nBulk Operation Endpoint\n\n\n\n\nThe supported operations are given later in this document.\n\n\nSCIM 1.1\n#\n\n\nThe endpoints URLS are incomplete withour the hostname.

Please remember to go through the specifications before using SCIM.\n\n\nEndpoint: User & Group\n#\n\n\nThe userinfo endpoint is given above in \nSection SCIM 1.1\n. The example below shows the userinfo endpoint for a Gluu Server with hostname \nidp.gluu.org\n:\n\n\nhttps://idp.gluu.org/host/seam/resource/restv1/scim/v1/Users{rsid}\n\n\n\n\nThe groups endpoint is given in \nSection SCIM 1.1\n.

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.\n\n\nIf the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.\n\n\nIn circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

An RPT is associated\nwith a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is\nauthorized for access. \n\n\nThe token's nature and format are dictated by its profile. The profile\nmight allow it to be self-contained, such that the resource server is\nable to determine its status locally, or might require or allow the\nresource server to make a run-time introspection request of the\nauthorization server that issued the token.\n\n\nThe endpoint MAY allow other parameters to provide further context to\nthe query. For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.\n\n\nTo prevent unauthorized token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also\nrequire some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as\nclient authentication as described in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] or a separate\nOAuth 2.0 access token such as the bearer token described in OAuth 2.0\nBearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant.

For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.
