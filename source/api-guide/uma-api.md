## UMA API Document
User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how 
resource owners can manipulate the protect resources.
The client can have access by arbitrary requesting parties, which means the 
requesting resource can be any number of resource servers and a centralized 
authorization server managing the access based on protected resource rules and policies defined.


In order to increase interoperable communication among the 
authorization server, resource server, and client, UMA leverages 
two purpose-built APIs related to the outsourcing of authorization, 
themselves protected by OAuth (or an OAuth-based authentication protocol) in embedded fashion.


The UMA protocol has three broad phases as below

```
                                          +--------------+
                                           |   resource   |

## UMA Authorization API

### Overview

### PATH

`/requester/perm`

### requestRptPermissionAuthorization

**POST** 

`/requester/perm`

Client Requests Authorization Data
Once in possession of a permission ticket and an AAT for this
authorization server, the client asks the authorization server to give
it authorization data corresponding to that permission ticket. It
performs a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header
and a JSON object in the body with a "ticket" property containing the
ticket as its value.

If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY
also provide that RPT in an "rpt" property in its request to the
authorization server.

In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party
claims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a "claim_tokens"
property in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The
authorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the
previously registered requested permission, maps the requested
permission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource
set identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests
additional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively
to the request for authorization data.

The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on
resource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous
OAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to
enable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to
interact with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent
to an access attempt. All such processes are outside the scope of this
specification.

## UMA Resource Registration API 

**/host/rsrc/resource_set**

### Overview
Resource set is defined by the resource server, which is required
by the authorization server to register the resource set description.

Resource set description is a JSON document with the 
following properties described in [ResourceSet](#ResourceSet)

RESTful API  is used by Resource Server at the authorization server's 
resource set registration endpoint to create, read, update, and delete 
resource set description.



Request to the resource set is registration is incorrect, the authorization
server responds with an with error message by including the below  error 
codes in the response. Discussed detail in [unsupported methods](#unsupportedHeadMethod)

- unsupported_method_type: The resource server request used an unsupported HTTP method. 
  The authorization server MUST respond with the HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code.
- not_found: The resource set requested from the authorization server cannot be 
  found. The authorization server MUST respond with HTTP 404 (Not Found) status code.

### PATH
 `/host/rsrc/resource_set{rsid}`

#### deleteResourceSet

**DELETE** `/host/rsrc/resource_set{rsid}`

Deletes a previously registered resource set description using the
DELETE method, thereby removing it from the authorization server's
protection regime.

### ResourceSetList

#### Path

**`/host/rsrc/resource_set`**

**GET** 

`/host/rsrc/resource_set`

Lists all previously registered resource set identifiers for 
this user using the GET method. 
The authorization server MUST return the list in
the form of a JSON array of {rsid} string values.

The resource server uses this method as a first step in checking whether
its understanding of protected resources is in full synchronization with
the authorization server's understanding.

##### requestRptStatus
**POST** `/rpt/status`

The resource server MUST determine a received RPT's status, including
both whether it is active and, if so, its associated authorization data,
before giving or refusing access to the client. An RPT is associated
with a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is
authorized for access. 

The token's nature and format are dictated by its profile. The profile
might allow it to be self-contained, such that the resource server is
able to determine its status locally, or might require or allow the
resource server to make a run-time introspection request of the
authorization server that issued the token.

The endpoint MAY allow other parameters to provide further context to
the query. For instance, an authorization service may need to know the
IP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to
determine the appropriateness of the token being presented.

To prevent unauthorized token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also
require some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as
client authentication as described in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] or a separate
OAuth 2.0 access token such as the bearer token described in OAuth 2.0
Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]. The methods of managing and validating
these authentication credentials are out of scope of this specification.

is the "access_token" value returned from the token endpoint as defined
in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] section 5.1. For refresh tokens, this is the
"refresh_token" value returned from the token endpoint as defined in
OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] section 5.1. Other token types are outside the scope
of this specification.</td>

introspection. The protected resource MAY pass this parameter in order
to help the authorization server to optimize the token lookup. If the
server is unable to locate the token using the given hint, it MUST
extend its search across all of its supported token types. An
authorization server MAY ignore this parameter, particularly if it is
able to detect the token type automatically. Values for this field are
defined in OAuth Token Revocation [RFC7009].</td>
