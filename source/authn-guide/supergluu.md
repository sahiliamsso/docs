# Super Gluu
## Overview
[Super Gluu](https://super.gluu.org) is a free and secure two-factor authentication mobile application developed by Gluu. It is based on the free open source [oxPush2](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxPush2) two-factor authentication application. 

This document will explain how to use the [oxPush2 interception script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/master/Server/integrations/super_gluu/oxPushExternalAuthenticator.py) to configure the Gluu Server for a two-step authentication process with username and password as the first step, and Super Gluu as the second step. 

In order to use this authentication mechanism users will need to download the Super Gluu mobile app from the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gluu.super.gluu) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-gluu/id1093479646?ls=1&mt=8)  marketplace.
