# User Authentication Introduction

Using the  Gluu Server, you can define the business logic for complex multi-step authentication workflows, providing SSO for people using smart cards, tokens, mobile or biometric authentication mechanisms. You don't have to chose one multi-factor authentication technology. You can have multiple authentication mechanisms active at the same time--Web or mobile clients can request a certain authentication type by using standard OpenID Connect request parameters.

A number of multi-factor authentication scripts are shipped in the Gluu Server by default, including support for FIDO U2F tokens, Gluu's free mobile two-factor application [Super Gluu](https://super.gluu.org), certificate authentication, and Duo Security. 

These user authentication methods are explained in detail and describes on how to setup in Gluu Server and use it effectively.

**Note: While configuring or setting up these authentications and 
run into issues ie, not able to login or facing error pages. please follow 
FAQ to troubleshoot. It is adviced to open the OXtrust in private tab 
or browser to avoid any issues in logging in later.**
