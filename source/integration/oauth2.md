## Overview 
Gluu offers commercial OAuth 2.0 client software called [oxd](https://oxd.gluu.org) to make securing and integrating applications with the Gluu Server easier. 

If you're using the Gluu Server as an OpenID Connect Provider (OP), your application can use any client software that implements the open standards the Gluu Server supports. However, you may want to consider using oxd because:

1. oxd is super-easy to use;      
2. We keep updating oxd to address the latest OAuth 2.0 security knowledge;      
3. We can provide more complete end-to-end support if we know both the client and server software;      
4. oxd subscriptions help support this project so you can see more enhancements faster;      
5. There are oxd libraries for Php, Python, Java, Node, Ruby, C#, .Net, Perl and Go. If your application is programmed in another language, oxd has a simple JSON/REST API;      
6. There are oxd plugins for many popular applications like: Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, OpenCart, SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Roundcube, Shopify, and Kong. More are being added too. Next on the list are: MatterMost, RocketChat, NextCloud, and Liferay.
